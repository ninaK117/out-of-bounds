189,Python: Issue with POST data in Requests,"I'm trying to use the Requests 2.9.1 in Python 2.7 to learn how to send POST data.  However I feel that I'm missing something in the data I'm providing to requests, or somehow misformating something and have been banging my head at it all night. The site I'm basing the form data off of is : http://qpublic9.qpublic.net/la_orleans_address.php I used Charles (https://www.charlesproxy.com) to see the actual content of the POST data, and here is what I saw.  The data I entered was 1013 for the Street Number (field is streetNumber) and ST ANN (relying on the autocomplete) for the *Street Name** (streetName is the field here).  This is all I needed to enter on the website manually, and I received this POST data from Charles:  Originally I was trying with just the streetNumber and streetName, since that was the only data I input when testing from the website, but this produced an error.  Now I'm entering null fields for the data that has nothing entered, I'm guessing this might be causing the problem but I'm not sure.  Below is what I'm using for code, followed by the error message I'm receiving (which is an SQL error message, making me think there's something wrong with the way I'm formatting the data payload perhaps).  The output and error:  Since I'm just a user, and not a developer for the site, I don't have access to see what their backend code looks like, but since it works from the site in my browser I'm guessing it's something to do with my payload formatting rather than their code. Any suggestions on what I might be missing?  Or any experience with similar problems?  No matter how many empty fields I remove I end up with that same error. Thanks! EDIT: In my code I'm not using the backslashes for the python code, I'm using that here for easier reading.  Also the error message doesn't have line breaks in it, again just for readability.  Since I'm not familiar with the structure of POST data I'm leaving that as is from Charles in case changing something might cause a miscommunication. EDIT 2: Also I'm receiving a response code of 200 () when I test for that, so it doesn't appear to be an error with the connection over HTTP, so again that makes me think I'm missing something with the POST data.","Take out all the  characters that you put between words.

192,Ajax load click function only works once,"I've been fiddling for a couple hours now and I can't figure out why this is happening. I've written a jquery navigation script that replaces content in a div called ""contentwrapper"". The content is supposed to hide, a loading animation is displayed then disappears, and the new content fades in. The problem is that the animation does not happen every other time. On first click, it works, but the page refreshes on the second click. The cycle continues. It's as if the click function is not active despite the use of . Here is my code:  Here it is in action I tried applying everything I could find on the interwebs, to no avail.","I think I know why this is happening. In your click handler, your final statement is:  Which indicates that you want the click event to be 'cancelled' after running your code (which AJAX-loads the content into the page). The problem is that it actually fails to prevent the click event to be 'cancelled'. Look at the URL/address bar in your browser: when you click on the header items, you will see that the URL changes. Your browser is reloading the page every time. Sometimes you will get to see the animation because the AJAX request completes before the browser loads the page. In order to fix this, I suggest you make your header elements something other than anchors (<a>). Make them inline paragraph blocks (<p>) or something. jQuery can detect clicks on any element so your code will work. Finally, if you do the above, and you still want to support browsers with JavaScript disabled, you could use a <noscript> block which would use the old-school anchors (with href attribute and everything) for those people. This is optional and only if you want support for users without Javascript (small minority).",0.2,0.0004158004158004158,0.0,0.14285714285714285,1.0,1,1

DB system is MYSQL running on Linux. Table A is structured like this one:  Table B is:  Looking at whole table A, I need to extract all rows where both type and subtype are present as columns in a single table B row. Of course this condition is never met since A.subtype can't be at same time equal to B.subtype1 AND B.subtype2 ...  In the example the result set for id should be:  I m trying to use a join with 2 AND conditions, but of course I got an empty set. EDIT: @Barmar thank you for your support. It seems that I m really near the final solution. Just to keep things clear, I opened this thread with a shortened and simplified data structure, just to highlight the point where I was stuck. I thought about your solution, and is acceptable to have both result on a single row. Now, I need to reduce execution time.  First join takes about 2 minutes to complete, and it produce around 23Million of rows. The second join (table B) is probably taking longer. In fact, I need 3 hours to have the final set of 10 millions of rows. How can we impove things a bit? I noticed that mysql engine is not threaded, and the query is only using a single CPU. I indexed all fields used by join, but I m not sure its the right thing to do...since I m not a DBA  I suppose also having to rely on VARCHAR comparison for such a big join is not the best solution. Probably I should rewrite things using numerical ID that should be faster..  Probably split things into different query will help parallelism. thanks for a feedback","You can join Table A with itself to find all combinations of types and subtypes with the same ID, then compare them with the values in Table B.  This returns the two rows from Table A as a single row in the result, rather than as separate rows, I hope that's OK.

The issue stands when both parties have pressed delete, one of the parties must press delete once again for it to be deleted from the database (removed the hiding part for testing purposes). The problem seems to be with the if statements, it wont go on to the third if statement after update query untill both colums are true, then it moves to the third if statement when delete is pressed for the third time. I've also tried putting the third if statement inside the 2 first if statements, still having the same problem though. Any thoughts?

I have a page to recover password, and the user needs to fill out the form with a valid data, in addition to performing the recaptcha test. To facilitate the user experience, I do the checks via ajax, if I do not return any errors, I free the page.  Okay, all normal .. But I've always heard that it is not to rely on any data on the client side. If they were able to change, for example, the signal from !== to ===, the user would be able to perform the search without performing the recaptcha. I thought of doing the recaptcha check twice, one in ajax, and one when the page was updated with the POST request, but the API returns an error because two requests were made in a short interval. My question is, is it possible for someone to do this?","If the application is implemented correctly, this should not allow the user to bypass the CAPTCHA check. The AJAX request validates the CAPTCHA response on the server. If it succeeds, the server should arrange for future API calls to be validated. It might return a token that has to be included in future API calls, set a cookie, or it could set a server-side session variable. When the application makes additional calls to the API, the server should check this data; if it's not valid, the calls are rejected. If you change  to , the user won't get an error message. But they still won't be able to use the application, because the above authentication information won't have been set up. The server still knows that you didn't give a correct CAPTCHA response. The upshot is that you can never do authentication entirely on the client. You can do client-side validation to improve the user experience, but it has to be duplicated on the server. And the server has to do it on every request; you can't assume that the client will follow the normal path through the pages of the application. For instance, even if you only link to  from ,  can't assume that the user has actually gone through the login checks -- there's nothing stopping someone from putting the  URL in the browser's address bar.  has to do something that the client can't spoof, and  has to verify that this has been done in the current session.",0.8,0.28482328482328484,0.0,0.0,0.006140265305108237,1,1

In their example they trigger onRefresh with this line onRefresh={this._onRefresh.bind(this)} They use this._onRefresh.bind(this) and if im not mistaken, what this is generally doing (without diving into details) making sure that we are invoking the _onRefresh function from the global scope. B) I found this documentation showing that I could invoke the triggering like so:  Note: this is from Stackoverflow's documentation, and for those who object to SOF's doc, im just interested in the difference between those lines of code.

I want to be able to click on the div submit the form and carry the variable of an $rmaNumber to $_POST so i can use it. Here is the live search function. When i click on the div it puts the rmaNumber into the rmaSearch input tag which is great but i was thinking if i used onclick=""document.rmaSearchForm.submit()"" on the div tag it would carry it over to the form action.  This is my html. That lays just below the jquery script above.  This is the dynamic search searchResults.php found in the jquery script.  If anyone has a better way of doing this I am well open for advice. Like i said i just started learning PHP, jquery, html/css and mysql in the past 6 months so i know my code is not as good as it should be but im still learning. If more information is needed please ask more than willing to tell more if i have left something out.","Do it this way:   with a selector argument performs event delegation to dynamically-added elements, like  used to.

518,define a Custom Property as a Data Object,"Found the issue on my payment Input control. There was a small computed Text field that was failing but not throwing an error. Just stopped the whole process. In any case removed the computedText and it now works. The compositeData formula that returns pItem to the custom control still fires way to often but I can't figure out how to stop that. It is all memory resident so it is probably not a major performance hit, but still..... This question is a follow up to my previous question and I will try to refine the issue defining an object property in a compositeData on a custom control Here is a picture of what I am trying to do:  The repeat control is bound to an arrayList generated by the Java method Payments.getAllItems(LinkKey) and that works correctly. The button in the repeat is fairly simple it just setts the viewScope.vsShowPayment = true and vsRIndex to the repeat Index value so I know which element in the ArrayList we are working with. It then does a refresh of the panelPaymentContainer which hides the repeat and renders the custom control ccTestPayment.  ccTestPayment has a custom property called pItem of the type java.lang.Object with this code:  the method in the class Payments Payments.getItem(rIndex) then returns the PaymentItem Object from the ArrayList of PaymentItems and displays them in custom control. the fields in the custom control are bound to compositeData.pItem.getPaymentDate etc and to this point everything is cool. I can edit any of the fields on the custom control and that all works fine. However, when I press the ""Save"" button none of the code in it gets executed.  None of the print statements get fired. I suspect it has something to do how pItem gets defined. the code behind the custom property gets fired over and over again and I'm wondering if that is getting in the way.",The reason that the save was not working was that there was a computed Text field on the control that generated an error. The problem was that there was no error message reported on the client nor the console. After a lot of head scratching I noticed the text filed was no longer displaying the value it was supposed to. Deleted the field and the save and everything else started to work. On the issue of the number of times the processes are called I think I have resolved many of them. I'm moving the control ccTestPaymentInput.xsp inside the repeat. It will now have direct access to the 'current' PaymentItem Object so I can access teh repeat var=pItem which is teh PaymentItem object I want to work with. Clean and far simpler than what I was doing. The only refreshes necessary are the ones related to the rpeat control and there is not much that I can do about that.,0.2,0.006237006237006237,0.0,0.0,0.008201745263657764,1,0

557,Pros and Cons of CreateMockAnything() of Mox (pymox) framework,"First of all the reason for the question - official pymox documentation: https://code.google.com/p/pymox/wiki/MoxDocumentation There is a statement in MockAnything section telling ""Don't use this unless you absolutely have to!"". I'm interesting why is that? Does it have some limitations? Personally I found it very useful. I have the following situation: I have a reference to the module in my class, the module have a bunch of module-level functions used by my class.   Since this is a module I can't mock it with CreateMock() because this is not a type. Therefore I used CreateMockAnything() which is perfect for this case. I know I can stub module functions with:  But I don't like this way because here I need to do two actions each time. It's simpler and prettier to have a reference to the module in the class, and mock it with CreateMockAnything. If I misprint some function name the expectation will simply fail (because the code being tested is calling the correct one), so this is not a point...  For StubOutWithMock: if I won't notice some additional db function call in tested method, and won't stub it StubOutWithMock, it will call the real code and left some garbage in the db. So one more point to protect my solution - using the CreateMockAnything instead of stubbing particular methods lets me to completely cut my db dependency, and I also will see the unexpected method call exception thrown by the MockAnything mock. So what are the reasons to avoid using of CreateMockAnything()? Thanks,","The main reason for this is that it is usually good programming practice to only use objects with well defined interfaces, where possible.

560,jquery changing multiple classes to affect z-index and other properties,"I'm not exactly sure how to go about this.  I have a feature I'm developing that is going to be using several different characteristics and only have the beginnings of it at this stage. My goal is to have 4 different boxes stacked over each other, somewhat like a tab.  I have it so that I can select one of the boxes and it comes to the front, but I'd like to be able to change the classes of the 3 remaining boxes accordingly so they stack neatly. JavaScript:  HTML:  This is what I have so far, with each div having a margin-top and margin-left off centered from the one it overlaps. I see many examples of toggling between two items, but this involves 4 different layers I know that I'll want to eventually use the easing and timer files as well as some other ones to slide the selected box smoothly to the front, and add a slight fading to non selected items.  I'm not sure how much bearing that has at this beginning stage though. At this point, I just need the boxes to stack correctly. I'm aiming to visually get an effect similar to that of pulling a card out of a deck and placing it on top.  It appears, that I might need to change the id as well, but I'm not sure how possible that is in jquery.

The question is even if I create my own extension and check for it before start reading, I can't know that the file was really created by my application, someone could just change the extension and my application won't get the data it needs (of course I'll put everything in a try and catch so the application won't crush).

569,How can I safely give MySQL DELETE power to my script?,"I seem to have painted myself into a corner with my efforts to run a secure PHP / MySQL site. I created a MySQL user that has minimal powers to run the site, so no DELETE privilege, amongst others, and it all works fine. Recently, I have added extensions that look for excessive users taking up too many resources and I ban them for 24 / 48 hours based on IP address. Not perfect, but it deters the average user from too much abuse.  That works fine too. The issue is that my list of 24 hour bans is in a table that grows at an alarming rate. Ideally I'd have a script that deletes everything in the table whose timestamp is older than the ban period as they are no longer needed. Then I could run that script from a cron job.  The problem is that that script fails because the user account credentials don't include DELETE privileges. If I create an extra user who does have DELETE, aren't I undermining the security of the whole site? Is there a middle way or other solution, or just some precautions that I can take. What's the best way to resolve this conflict? ","The whole point of having separate accounts is so that you can give each account the privileges appropriate to its duties. If you need to delete things, you obviously have to create an account with DELETE privileges. But that doesn't undermine everything, because all the other accounts are still restricted. Furthermore, this account doesn't have to have widespread  privileges. You can just grant it the privilege to  in the table that lists bans. Although if you try to get too fine-grained with permissions, you're likely to drive yourself crazy.  Finally, if you have an account that has  privileges, it's not so bad to allow it  privileges as well.

My problem is debugging, as I'm not sure if this is a Hibernate problem or a Spring problem in disguise. I thought I would ask here before doing some major refactoring.   I have two Entities.  One holds a collection of the other in a OneToMany relationship.  For my web page I wish to grab all of the first entity, and subsequently grab the set of associated entities for each and display them.   I believe my problem is this: I use a JpaTemplate to find all entities.  This works fine, however because of Lazy loading I do not get the associated set of related entities.  In my view (jsp) I want access to this set, but of course it is null because it is being lazy loaded.  Now, i'm getting a LazyInitialization exception stating that the transaction has ended.  To me this makes sense, of course the transaction should be over by now.  The thing is, how can the assoicated set ever be lazy loaded if the transaction is over?

And bulding an object of references should be more efficient than sorting the array in place and actually 'moving' the data. I assume it is similar to using pointers. I included the snippet of the sort below just for illustration, even though it is likely not as efficient, because it was interesting to someone at my lower level to build a sort function based off of an object property.

The problem is, I'd like to have the site available in multiple languages; So I've already translated the CMS itself and put it in files like:    en.ini nl.ini  Which works fine for the CMS' contents itself, like the Administration etc. The actual problem occurs when I try to translate the website further: The blogposts and pages are stored in a database, so they're dynamic. My pages table's structure looks like this:    So, if I were to translate a page into, for example, Dutch, I don't want to create a new table called  for example, because most of the information would be the same as the other table. I could add a row which contains the page's available languages, and make php read the array and parse if the current  matches one of the page's available languages, and then read the  and  row as an example. The same problem would occur with my blog posts, and I have searched for a solution, but most results were for specific CMSs and just plugins.   I'm asking what would be the best way (and database structure) to store multilingual pages/posts, where languages could be added dynamically and have a fallback on the original content if there's no translated version available.","Basically you add a lang-key to your database  Now lets say a request comes for a page with 5 content elements in it.

Let say you have translated Content 1, 3 and 5:   Another way would be to do the translation in the template files (like magento does it). In magento you have something like that:  And translation files. For example lang.nl:  In this case you will have only 1 Content Element, but you will wrap every element that shall be translated. This also works with images and everything you want. You can also abstract this wrapper to work in a backend RTE-Editor. For example, you will write  in your backend then mark and click the translation button. This will add a Tag around English and when you render the content you scan for this tags and replace it if you find any translation for this string in the requested language.

849,PHP Mutual Exclusion on a File / MySQL reading and executing statements from a file using perl,"So I was wondering how / if PHP has some sort of mutual exclusion on file reading and writing.

Information CAN be passed through the payment service and regurgitated on the other end. However, there is minimum information that can be passed. My idea of a solution: Before a registration is passed to the payment service, process and write the sql statements in a file, with each group of statements referring to a registration separated by some token.  On returning find the entry based on the information you sent through the payment service, execute the statements and remove the registration block from the file.

Assumes that n is a value of the cell so (n - num) is a positive number (not zero).  I can't use any loops (for,while,...etc)  the Method:  For example:  if we search for the longest path with the difference number = 1  1-in the cell matrix[0][3] the path long is 3 and the value in this path is 33 -> 32 -> 31  ends in matrix[1][4] 2-in the cell matrix[1][0] the path long is for 6 and the value in the path 60 -> 59 -> 58 -> 57 -> 56 -> 55 ends in matrix[2][4] 3-in the cell matrix[1][0] the path long is 2 and the value in this path is 60 -> 59   ends in matrix[2][0] so the method must return the longest path witch its 6 if we search for the longest path with the difference number = 2 1-in the cell matrix[2][1] the path long is 3 and the value in this path is 17 -> 15 -> 13  ends in matrix[3][2] the method must return the longest path witch its 3.

To check all neighbors, it is enough to check right and down neighbors to cover all1:   1: If you are interested in descending paths going up or left, you need to check 4 directions. This is because your graph is directed. For example, a path which may not be valid going left to right, may be valid going right to left.

948,powershell stderr redirect breaks lines every few characters,"UPDATE: this seems to be specific to uncaught exceptions inside a function called by the slot/signal flow of PyQt5 (PyQt 5.11 running in Python 3.7.0).  See UPDATE farther down this question text.  The overall goal is to tee the stdout and stderr of a python program to screen and to the same file, on a Windows 10 machine; I'd prefer to do this redirection at the operating system level (i.e. the shell that invokes python - Windows in this case); doing it cleanly from within the python program hasn't worked out at any rate. Check out the broken stderr redirection lines below. radiolog.py is a large python program which shouldn't be relevant here; inside it I trigger an exception in order to test this logging workflow.    radiolog_log.ps1 is a powershell wrapper around radiolog.py:  Running radiolog_log.ps1 from inside a powershell terminal:  There are some good posts and answers out there about powershell stderr redirection splitting lines at the width of the console... however, this one seems to be splitting the lines every few characters, and it's not the same each time. The | % ToString gets rid of the (in this case) redundant layer of powershell's exception handling; without | % ToString it looks like this (everything beginning with 'python: Traceback' is in red text):  Another attempt is to run a .bat file from the powershell terminal, then do the tee in powershell. radiolog_log.bat:  In the powershell terminal:  which results in the following terminal display - everything as expected:  However log.dat is written in unicode, i.e. is not human-readable as a plain text file.  Microsoft says as much in the Tee documentation here - not sure why...?  Found a question about converting it to ascii on the fly, but, it doesn't look like you can have the same real-time file and terminal output, negating a big part of the reasoning for tee in the first place. Any ideas on how to get everything to just play nice like it would in linux?  UPDATE: PyQt5 slot/signal flow seems to be triggering this behavior.  Example code, massively pared down from the original radiolog.py:  In a powershell terminal, after defining STD-Handler as per the earliest answer to this question (not required to observe the broken lines, but, it does make cleaner output without the powershell-exception header as well as making a plain-text log file), then execute as follows:  Click the button in the GUI and you get this:  Now uncomment the line in the python code as noted, so that the exception is called from code rather than from user interaction; run the same line at the powershell terminal and you get this:  So, this probably merits a new question to the PyQt community which I'll put together soon and cross-reference here - though help on this thread would still be great!","Partial Bingo - some other questions talk about the way PyQt5 treats uncaught exceptions.  Not really sure of the interactions between PyQt's stderr handling and powershell's stderr handling, but, overriding sys.excepthook in python to have the 'old' behavior does the trick.  Here's the new entire r.py python code - the only changes from the updated question code are the 'def except_hook' and 'sys.excepthook = except_hook' in the 'if name' clause:  Now, clicking the button produces this output:  Sometimes (not repeatably) it comes out a bit fractured at punctuation and such, but, this is a lot more manageable:  And this better-behaved output happens in the full program too (radiolog.py).

A single unit of data in this set has a set of immutable attributes + state attached to it. The state is dynamic and can change at any time. The requirements are as follows -  Large sets of data can experience state changes. Updates need to be fast. I should be able to aggregate data pivoted on various attributes.  Ideally - there should be a way to correlate individual data units to an aggregated results i.e. I want to drill down into the specific transactions that produced a certain aggregation.  (I am aware of the race conditions here, like the state of a data unit changing after an aggregation is performed ; but this is expected).  All aggregations are time based - i.e. sum of x on pivot y over a day, 2 days, week, month etc.   I am evaluating different technologies to meet these use cases, and would like to hear your suggestions. I have taken a look at Hive/Pig which fit the analytics/aggregation use case. However, I am concerned about the large bursts of updates that can come into the system at any time. I am not sure how this performs on HDFS files when compared to an indexed database (sql or nosql).  ","You'll probably arrive at the optimal solution only by stress testing actual scenarios in your environment, but here are some suggestions. First, if write speed is a bottleneck, it might make sense to write the changing state to an append-only store, separate from the immutable data, then join the data again for queries. Append-only writing (e.g., like log files) will be faster than updating existing records, primarily because it minimizes disk seeks. This strategy can also help with the problem of data changing underneath you during queries. You can query against a ""snapshot"" in time. For example, HBase keeps several timestamped updates to a record. (The number is configurable.) This is a special case of the persistence strategy called Multiversion Concurrency Control - MVCC. Based on your description, MVCC is probably the most important underlying strategy for you to perform queries for a moment in time and get consistent state information returned, even while updates are happening simultaneously.   Of course, doing joins over split data like this will slow down query performance. So, if query performance is more important, then consider writing whole records where the immutable data is repeated along with the changing state. That will consume more space, as a tradeoff.",0.2,0.01704781704781705,0.3333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0,0

After they sign in, I check to see if the local database has data, if not, I go to Parse and download from there then to insert data into local database. The strange thing is the sequence of events is not happening as I would expect and this is where my issue is. SigninVC is below:  RLDatabase.swift has the insert to SQLite  ParseArrayModel.swift  As you can see, the first call is to download from Parse, then call the insert function.  However, what is happening is it goes to the downloadFromParse, but after the   it skips OVER the the remainder of the function, then goes to the insertToSQLite function and as there is no data in the array, nothing gets inserted.  Then it goes back to the DownloadFromParse and then grabs the data.  So, in the end, all the data is there, but in the wrong sequence of events. Completely stumped.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Therefore the error will be a magnitude larger than the error of the fraction. But it is still usually a lot smaller than 0.1, and therefore it will usually not cause  to behave in an unexpected way. This piece of code is totally fine (as long as you don't use it with very large / very small numbers). proof: The maximum rounding error between a number  and it's (imprecise) representation  fullfills the formula , or in other words: The error growths linear to our number , and will always be smaller than  ( being the Machine Epsilon - the largest possible relative error).  For floating-point multiplication of , the result is , whereas . Therefore if we combine the error of representation and multiplication we end up at:  Now assuming the worst case (that  is ), it results in:  That is, our relativ rounding error is  at max.

1082,JQuery Locally Stored Values for RadioButtons missing Values for Postback,"I wonder if someone can help me with my issue where I have some RadioButtons which are dynamically refreshed, but if someone edits these I want to retain the values if the content is refreshed again.  So far I have a working solution up until I save the form, where the RadioButton values are lost. Let me explain: On our form, the content is fetched each time a Role Criteria radio button is checked. If a user makes some selections of radio buttons and comment text within the content this is the lost if the user decides to add an extra Role Criteria.  Note that there are many radio buttons and comments fields on this page, and they change depending on selection. To correct this I added some jQuery to store the values of RadioButtons and Comments in Local Storage then repopulate the values once the context area is redrawn.  The radio buttons in question are created in a Partitial View (MVC) using Razor, on page they appear like this: - Note the values True & False.  This is the basic call I use to store and restore the selections of the user and works visually as I expect: Called before the AJAX fires to update the content:  Called after the AJAX call redraws the content on a Successful call:  This is works well and the user is none the wiser.  However on save things are a little different.  Once the Postback is happening the values of the Radio buttons is lost.  I need to use these so I can use Form.Request to pick up the values. Looking at Fiddler the parameters sent back to the server are the RadioButton names, but the values are empty.   TextComments go through so I know its something to do with how the radiobutton is being checked.  If I save a fresh form without the JQuery repopulating anything then all values are as they should be, i.e radiobutton name value is True or False. However after the JQuery restores the items, the value parameter on each input is “” blank, I notice the checked value doesn’t move either, but not sure this does normally either.  I’ve tried to force the value in there with a  bit more JQuery but haven’t had any luck, whatever I’ve tried. I’ve tried setting these items manually to try and force it to have a value, without success. Whats going on, can anyone help?

1087,Scrapy - Build URLs Dynamically Based on HTTP Status Code?,"I'm just getting started with Scrapy and I went through the tutorial, but I'm running into an issue that either I can't find the answer to in the tutorial and/or docs, or I've read the answer multiple times now, but I'm just not understanding properly... Scenario:  Let's say I have exactly 1 website that I would like to crawl. Content is rendered dynamically based on query params passed in url. I will need to scrape for 3 ""sets"" of data based on URL pram of ""category"". All the information I need can be grabbed from common base URLs like this: ""http://shop.somesite.com/browse/?product_type=instruments"" And the URls for each category like so: ""http://shop.somesite.com/browse/?q=&product_type=instruments&category=drums"" ""http://shop.somesite.com/browse/?q=&product_type=instruments&category=keyboards"" ""http://shop.somesite.com/browse/?q=&product_type=instruments&category=guitars"" The one caveat here, is that the site is only loading 30 results per initial request. If the user wants to view more, they have to click on button ""Load More Results..."" at the bottom. After investigating this a bit, during initial load of page, only the request for top 30 is made (which makes sense), and after clicking the ""Load More.."" button, the URL is updated with a ""pagex=2"" appended and the container refreshes with 30 more results. After this, the button goes away and as user continues to scroll down the page, subsequent requests are made to the server to get the next 30 results, ""pagex"" value is incremented by one, container refreshed with results appended, rinse and repeat. I'm not exactly sure how to handle pagination on sites, but the simplest solution I came up with is simply finding out what the max number ""pagex"" for each category, and just set the URLs to that number for starters.  For example, if you pass URL in browser: ""http://shop.somesite.com/browse/?q=&product_type=instruments&category=drums&pagex=22"" HTTP Response Code 200 is received and all results are rendered to page. Great! That gives me what I need! But, say next week or so, 50 more items added, so now the max is ""...pagex=24"" I wouldn't get all the latest. Or is 50 items removed and new max is ""...pagex=20"", I will get 404 response when requesting ""22"". I would like to send a test response with the last known ""good"" max page number and based on HTTP Response provided, use that to decide what URL will be. So, before I start any crawling, I would like to add 1 to ""pagex"" and check for 404. If 404 I know I'm still good, if I get 200, I need to keep adding 1 until I get 404, so I know where max is (or decrease if needed).

1156,Dynamically access multiple databases?,My question is very related to this one: Multiple dynamic data sources for a servlet context. However I haven’t found a proper solution just yet and would like to ask it again. I have a little JSF application that talks to a MS SQL Server via JDBC. Tomcat is used as the web container. The application retrieves and stores its data from a single database. A login screen is provided. If the credentials match the ones stored in the database then access is granted and I can play around with the application. Now I would like to add more databases and provide a login screen which not only requests the username and password but the database name as well. Different databases are used because I would like to have some for testing and development. The backup plans are also not the same for every database. Currently I use JNDI Resources to look up the databases in my code. However this forces me to edit context.xml and web.xml and to restart tomcat.  I don’t want to do that. The restart forces me to run around an tell everyone: “Hey I am rebooting do you mind losing all your connections?” Is the some more dynamic way to do that?  ,"For your purposes, you should really have three separate application server instances (either on three separate machines, or on the same machine listening to different ports, or different host headers etc). The development server instance should always look up the development database, the staging server looks up the staging database etc, and JNDI should be set up to reflect this. That's what JNDI is for. That said, if you must set things up with just a single application server, you will probably need to look into writing a custom authentication realm that does this.

I have a parent object 'Post' with a collection of child objects 'Comment'. The collection is mapped as a set with inverse on the Comment side. What I am trying to do is to return only comments with a status enum value of 'Comment.Approved'  The relevant portions of the entity classes are as follows:  My retrieval code looks like this at the moment:  While this works the SQL doesn't appear to be very efficient, I expected to be able to translate the following SQL into something similar in HQL or an ICriteria of some sort:  I've had a look at the various answers related to this type of query here and none of them seem to address this specific scenario. There's probably something very simple I'm missing here but I'm too tired now to see it. Here's hoping someone better with NHibernate can point me in the right direction. Thanks for your time. Edit: Still struggling with this, some of the answers here are good in that I'm starting to think that my post entity needs to be re-thought to perform the filtration itself, or that I should implement a ViewModel to filter the comments I want. The question still remains however, even if only from an academic perspective. I've updated the selection to HQL and tried:  This works as long as a post has an approved comment, otherwise I get no post due to the SQL generated using 'AND' in the where clause. Anyone? I'm stumped now! Update: Thanks to all who have replied, it has been useful and has forced me to re-evaluate portions of my model. Since the most frequent use of comments as children of a post is in the viewing of a post, only the approved comments should be viewable in this scenario. In most other scenarios that I can think of comments would be accessed directly and filtered by status which is of course straight forward. I have updated my mappings to filter all post > comment loading to only load approved posts as follows (in FluentNHibernate):  I wish I could mark all as the answer since all contributed to me working this thing out, but Peter was the first to point out that I may be thinking about the model incorrectly.

I expected that literal comparison would be faster, but it seems like the typeof comparison is almost twice as fast. Sidenote: I know this doesn't matter for almost any practical purpose. Here is the benchmark code (disclaimer: I don't know how to benchmark): https://jsperf.com/check-if-boolean-123","It depends. To give an absolute answer, we would have to compile every piece of code / watch the interpreter on every possible browser / architecture combination. Then we could give an absolute answer which operation takes fewer processor cycles, everything else is pure speculation. And that's what I'm doing now: The naive approach Let's assume that engines do not perform any optimizations. That they just perform every step as defined in the specification. Then for every testcase the following happens:  (1) The type of  gets looked up. As the engine probably represents a generic ""JavaScript Value"" as a structure with a pointer to the actual data and an enum for the type of the value, getting a string describing the type is probably a lookup in a type -> type string map. (2) Now we have two string values, that we have to compare (). First of all, it has to be checked that the types equal. That is probably done by comparing the type field of both values, and a bitwise equality (meaning: one processor op).  (3) Finally the value has to be compared for equality. For strings this means iterating over both strings and comparing the characters to each other.  (1) First of all, the types of  and  and  ad  have to be compared as described above. (2) Secondly the values have to be compared, for booleans that's bitwise quality (meaning: one processor op). (3) The last step is the or expression. Given two values, they first have to be checked for truthiness (which is quite easy for booleans, but still we have to check again that these are really booleans), then the or operation can be done (bitwise or, meaning: one processor op).  So which one is faster? If I had to guess, the second approach, as the first one has to do string equality, which probably takes a few iterations more. The optimal approach A very clever compiler might realize that  is only true if the type of x is boolean. SO it could be optimized to (C++ pseudocode):  This is just a few processor ops, so it is really fast. In comparison to the naive approach, we save a string comparison and multiple typechecks. Will the engine do such optimization? Probably, because  checks are quite common, and are quite easy to optimize (so it's an easy win).  Can we optimize  ? Well, yes, as we know the type of  and  this can be boiled down to (C++ pseudocode):  Can't it be optimized further? Can't the compiler see that  and  are mutually exclusive, and therefore it is actually exactly the same as the code above. Will the compiler do that optimization? I don't know. It is definetly not that easy, and optimizing  is actually an easy optimization the developer can take.  So in a perfect world, with a very thoughtful compiler, the first one will be faster. But will the compiler optimize that much? It depends. Today, engines take the naive approach first (cause compilation does cost time too), and will only optimize if a function gets hot (gets called often). That's the case in your testcases (that's why the second one is faster). Wether real world code gets hot really depends on the usecase. takeaway On my device the first version performs 451,701,256 ops / s (!!). Given that the processor runs at 1.5 GHz, that's about 3 processor cycles per operation. Is that fast? YES! The second version performs at 198,308,952 ops / s. That's about 7 processor cycles per operation. Is that twice as slow? Yes. Is it slow! NO! There are probably other pieces of code that consume much more processor cycles. further thoughts A very common optimization is to compile down functions after deducing the datatypes of the arguments. That means if you do  The function might get compiled down to   Now what happens if you call  ? Well, at the entrypoint of the function, the types get asserted, the assertion fails, and the engine has to fall back to interpretation / recompile the function. Therefore calling the function 100000 times with booleans and then 100000 times with strings is probably faster than calling the function 200000 times with strings / booleans randomly.

While your shared library suggests you are using Wink 1.4,the source code line numbers in the stack trace more closely align to Wink 1.2.1.  Perhaps this issue is resolved in a more current version of Wink. Your config is definitely error-prone since you are using the jaxrs-2.0 feature (which, among other things tells the Liberty server to make the JAX-RS 2.0 API packages available to applications) but trying to use a different JAX-RS provider.  There is also a version conflict here - Wink implements JAX-RS 1.1.  If I'm understanding this config correctly, you are using Wink as the JAX-RS provider, but using the JAX-RS 2.0 APIs that ship with Liberty.  Even if this is not the cause of the problem you are seeing, it is likely to cause problems later. If you want to use Wink, I would suggest removing it from your application, and then using the jaxrs-1.1 feature (instead of the jaxrs-2.0 feature).  Liberty's jaxrs-1.1. implementation is Wink and it makes many of the Wink-specific APIs available.  If you just need a JAX-RS provider (nothing Wink-specific), then I would suggest removing the Wink libraries from your app, and use the CXF implementation that is built-in to the jaxrs-2.0 feature.

1257,Grouping items in PHP database query,"I think this is a fairly simple problem, though it's a little difficult to explain. Let's start with a list of state symbols - state flags, flowers, birds, etc. The rows in my MySQL database match each symbol with the URL at which its page appears. So if field Designation = 'flower', then the URL will be arizona/flower, new-york/flower, or something like that. However, some states have multiple symbols in various categories; e.g. two state birds, three state flowers, etc. Making it still more confusing, I haven't yet figured out if I should describe all of a state's flower symbols on one page or make a unique page for each flower symbol. For the time being, I'm playing it by ear, as indicated by the following database data. In this example, Arizona has two flower symbols, each discussed on the same page (URL = arizona/flower).  However, Florida has FOUR official mammals. The first one (the Florida panther) is discussed @ mysite/florida/mammal. The two marine mammals are discussed at mysite/florida/mammal2, and the state horse is featured @ mysite/florida/mammal3. So here's my question: How can I write a query that 1) distinguishes between single designations (e.g. Arizona's state tree) and multiple designations (e.g. Arizona's state flowers) and 2) also tells me if the multiple designations are linked to a single URL or multiple URL's? It will take me a while to iron out all the kinks, but, for now, it would be very helpful if I had a query that listed ONLY multiple URL's. For example, it wouldn't even display Arizona's state tree. The query could serve as sort of a snapshot of my list of symbols, helping me identify all the multiple designations and which of them are linked to single URL's vs multiple URL's.

I have the URLs in an object like this:  I want to fetch the data by iterating over the object containing the URLs, turn it into an array of JSX objects, then store the result in my main object's state.  It should fetch the data from the  URL and store the formatted result in . Then it should do the same thing for , storing the result in . What it actually seems to do is fetch  twice. This makes no sense to me at all. I don't even have a guess as to what is happening. I have noticed that if I put log statements into fetch's arrow function it shows that it's hitting both keys and both URLs, but if I put log statements at the end of the  arrow function, after , it shows  twice. It's processing the second URL twice. I know that the order isn't guaranteed, but it does tend to process them in the order in which I defined them and I think that's significant here.

1332,How to bind events to html generated by templating/data binding engines (No Jquery),"When using a templeting engine such as Handlebars.js or a data binding one such as Rivets.js, content in the view is generated or updated based on changes in your model. That means that the content itself will lose any event listeners bound to it upon initial generation if the model ever changes.  I could go into the framework itself and customize it to add my specific listener to a specific type of content when it is generated, but this seems like a horrible idea in terms of maintainability and scale etc.  I could bind an event listener to the model object so that when it's changed new listeners are bound to the resulting view, but this seems like it would add a whole lot of overhead. Or the cleanest way I have thought of is simply having the event listener as an attribute in the html template itself, invoking a globally accessible function.  This way whenever the template is re-rendered, or a single item in that list is re-rendered (if using rivets) the listener will be automatically in the rendered html.  My question is if however there is an even better way of doing this, perhaps a standard? How do MVC frameworks like Angular.js or Ember.js handle this sort of thing?

I'm trying to process a large number of inserts in the mySQL Python connector with a large number of column values that I don't want to deal with individually, and none of the typical alternatives work here. Here is a sketch of my code:  My main problem is that setting  as the default in the dictionary results in either  being inserted or an error if I specify the row as . I have a large number of columns that might change in the future so I'd want to avoid setting different 'default' values for different entries if at all possible. I can't do the typical way of inserting  by skipping over columns on the insert because while those columns might have the  value, I can't guarantee it and considering I'm doing a large number of inserts I don't want to change the query string each time I insert depending on if it's default or not. The other way of inserting  seems to be to have  as one of the parameters (e.g. ) but in my case setting the default in the dictionary to  results in error (mySQL complains about it being an incorrect integer value on trying to insert into an integer column, making it seem like it's interpreting the default as a string and not a keyword).

1386,Batch MYSQL inserts for performance in DB structure migration,"I need to restructure my MYSQL InnoDB database. At the moment I have a  table holding 3 product names. I need to extract these names to a new  table. The  table should hold each name currently held in the  table and be linked to the  table via a new  table. While the product names may not be unique, they don't have anything to do with each other, meaning for each  there will need to be inserted 3 new entries into the  table and 3 new entries into the  table. So instead of this:  I need this:  I've written the following MYSQL procedure that works:   This is too slow. I've run this locally and estimate that my ~15k customers would take ~1h to complete. And my VPS server is far slower than that, so it could take upward to 10h to complete. The problem seem to be the inserts taking a long time. I've would therefore like to store all the inserts during the procedure and execute them all in batch after the loop is complete and I know what to insert. I there a way to perform all the ~100k inserts in batch to optimize performance, or is there a better way to do it?  FINAL EDIT: I marked the correct solution based on that it did an excellent job of speeding up the process massively, which was the main focus of the question. In the end I ended up performing the migration using modified production code (in Java), due to the solution's limitations regarding not escaping the inserted strings. ","First, use a cursor to process the results of a single query, rather than performing a separate query for each row. Then concatenate the  lists into strings that you execute using  and . My code does the inserts in batches of 100 customers, because I expect there's a limit on the size of a query.   Beware that, using this solution, the product names will not be properly escaped before inserting. This solution will therefore not work if any of the product names contains special characters, such as single quote .",0.2,0.0058212058212058215,0.3333333333333333,0.14285714285714285,1.0,1,1

The parameters will simply be  (the minimum number),  (the maximum number), and  (the name of the table to check to see if the id produced by the  function already exists).

I have created a stored procedure as shown below:  Whenever I run the following code:  I get this error:  I'm at a loss for what's wrong.

As it is the first version, I only want the scrambler to be random move and not random state, as it is too much complicated to make, and it will come in a future update. I have an algorithm that basically makes an array of random moves that it chooses from the possibilities, and then checks if two of the same letters (or moves) are not next to one another. That all works fine, But I have no clue how to add something that would avoid cases as follow: ""D U D"" for example. Two same moves separated by another move are acceptable For example ""D R D"", but not ""D U D"", as it would be equal to ""D2 U"", and thus, be a wasted move. Information fro non-cubers: each letter represents its face that gets moved when the letter is read. For example: ""L U L"": ""L"" would mean to rotate the left face clockwise once, then ""U"" would mean to rotate the Upper face clockwise, and finally ""L"" again would mean to rotate the left face again. if a letter is followed by an apostrophe, then it means that the face should be rotated counter-clockwise. If it is followed by a ""2"", it means that the face should be rotated two times in a row.

1553,C Reading data from one file and writing it into another file,"The Problem: I have a project I'm working on that works with Binary Search Trees and file input/output. The binary search tree seems to functioning properly, however one of the requirements is to be able to add data to the binary tree via input from a file (And later output all the binary tree data). I used the fgets+sscanf method to look through the file, and it appears that it grabs all the items correctly, but the strings get drastically altered. I suspect it to be a null terminator issue but cannot pinpoint where exactly I could fix it at. When I add nodes to the binary tree manually (not from the file), they are added without issue, and are written to a new text file without issue. The only issue comes from reading the data from a file, which is throwing some odd errors that modify my data (E.G. strings appear in weird formats like é@—Ç as opposed to the expected output of FirstName1 LastName1). Also would like to apologize, I am still fairly new to C. So it may appear a little messy.  My (futile) attempts: As noted in the code below, I attempted manually adding null terminators to the strings since I believed that to be the issue. I've attempted changing the file contents and adding null terminators there, and I've tried using fscanf method of reading the file instead as well. I researched other stackoverflow pages searching for something I might be missing, but I haven't found anything. I'm sure it's something silly that I've overlooked.  My text files: Again, these below text file contents are only concerning from what is added from the file.

The ""count-back-to-backs"" function counts the number of pairings in which a contestant goes back to back. This is a metric ... or criteria ... that you judge the array of pairings by. The main loop runs a large number of randomizer loops and remembers the configuration with the fewest back-to-back contests. You can vary the number of loops. You can also add other functions to gather metrics about a particular set of pairings and keep/reject based on those metrics. This solution is thus: (1) generate random pairings and (2) keep/reject the array of pairings based on one or more criteria and (3) let the computer generate a large number of these random sets for your judgement. The output is the array of pairings with the number of back-to-backs on the end like [3 - 5, 2 - 4, 1 - 5, 2 - 3, 1 - 4, 2 - 5, 3 - 4, 1 - 2, 4 - 5, 1 - 3]0 ",0.2,0.04948024948024948,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.029206753555592775,1,1

While a separate upload button is created on each row, they each reference the same params.id which is set to the last row's value (i.e. 222).  I need each to be set to the value of their specific row. One way to fix it is to have each uploader have it's own upload_obj, but this seems like a waste of memory. Instead, I tried to reference data-id within the uploader_obj.  I can do so within onSubmit, however, haven't figured out how to use this value to set param.id.  I've tried to set it within param by doing something like  but this is my document, and not the uploader. So...  Without making a separate uploader_obj for each row, how could I make each row's uploader sent its own param.id to the server?  Thank you PS.  Sorry for the weak title.

While I was learning C#/Monogame, I learned about functions that repeat very quickly to update game elements. So, I was wondering if javascript works in the same manner. Does the Javascript engine repeatedly check every single event binding to see if it has occurred? So a structure something like this:  Or is Javascript somehow able to actually just trigger the function when the event occurs? In short: Do Javascript bindings take up memory solely by existing? My (inconclusive) research so far: I have made several attempts at answering this question on my own. First, I did a jsperf test. Apart from the obvious problems with consistency in my test, the test didn't actually test this question. It primarily tested if unbinding nothing was faster than unbinding something. Rather than how much memory the actual bindings take up after creation. I couldn't come up with a way to test this using this testing service. I then googled around a bit, and found quite a bit of interesting stuff, but nothing directly answering this question in clear terms. I did come across this answer, which suggests using a single event binding of the event container in a similar situation. UPDATE: Right after posting this, I thought of a possible way to test this with local JS:  After playing around with this(changing what the for loop does, changing the number of iterations on both for loops, etc.) it appears that event bindings take up a VERY small amount of memory.","Yes, they all take up memory, but not very much. There's just one function object. Each element has a pointer to that object, so it's probably something like 4 bytes per element. As Felix King suggested, you can reduce this by using delegation, as there's just a single binding to a container element. However, the savings in memory is offset by increased time overhead -- the handler is invoked every time the event occurs anywhere in the container, and it has to test whether the target matches the selector to which the event is delegated.",0.2,0.006237006237006237,0.3333333333333333,0.2857142857142857,1.0,1,0

For example, if we link to a  file near the end of the , and the download time of that  file is 2 or 3 seconds later, and the DOM has long been ready and the event already fired and all listeners notified, and now the JS code does  and it really is too late now, and the handler will never get called? In practice, it does not and should not happen, because then there would be weird behaviors. So how is this handled? Does the browser ""retroactive"" notify the listeners (even though the listener was added too late, the browser will notify it?). Having said that, the ""browser will notify the listener even if added too late"" isn't true, if we register the DOM ready listener inside of the DOM ready handler:       Another way is when we load a page, and then in the debug console, type in  It is even true that if we missing the current event cycle, then it won't be called:       So what is the rule about if the listener is added too late?","No, this isn't a problem.

1952,Are gcc's dynamically-sized arrays effectively identical to standard arrays after declaration?,"In standard C and C++ the address of an array is the array itself, and  returns the size of the array, not the pointer. However, does 's extension of dynamically-sized arrays offer the same guarantee?

Are there any times where using a dynamically-sized instead of a statically-sized array will result in different program behaviour? ※ Note I'm interested in if it works, not how to write it better using , etc","Straight from the ISO C99 doc, page 80:  The sizeof operator yields the size (in bytes) of its operand, which   may be an       expression or the parenthesized name of a type. The size is determined from the type of       the operand. The result is an integer. If the type of the operand is a variable length        array type, the operand is evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated        and the result is an integer constant.  So the answer to your first question is that it's guaranteed by the C99 standard, which gcc presumably follows. As for whether there are times it'll behave differently from a statically sized array well...not if you're using them sanely. While I can't find record of this in ISO C99, it appears that gcc always puts a VLA on the stack - which makes sense because it's essentially an alloca(), and is intended to go out of scope at the end of the block. Used sanely, there should never be any difference between how a dynamically sized array behaves and how a statically sized array behaves. Used insanely however, yes there could be extreme corner cases for exploitation (or other hacky) behavior where a person doing exploitation might be happy to discover you're using one over the other. Regardless, you can probably feel comfortable using whichever one you feel comfortable with.

Inside Abstract folder there are 6 interfaces , .. etc. Each interface has something like this :  And inside  folder there are another 7 classes : , ... and  which inherites from  class. Each class of the above (except ), implements each of the corresponding interface. Now when i thought about it i found that i could make one interface which defines all the entities and only one class inside  folder which implements that interface.  I really don't know what's better :  6 interfaces, 6 classes for each entity. OR 1 interface, 1 class which returns all entities.","You seem to have stumbled upon the Repository pattern. The typical architectural decision is to create an interface  Then have your ORM class implement the repository interface.  Now at this point, to answer your question, should I use 6 classes and 6 interfaces or 1 class and 1 interface the answer is categorically NO! The typical pattern calls for a GENERIC interface (so in effect you have 6 interfaces, but a single interface source, if you need extra calls you can extend the generic).  Then your EfContext exposes all of the interfaces. The reason being is that your controllers only typically need a single interface to work, and this makes mock/fake testing MUCH MUCH easier on your controllers (you don't need to create implementations of unused methods like an InfoQuery for a GalleryControllerTest). If you find you need to have domain specific code for any interface you could extend the IRepository interface.  Finally, implementation of this pattern will make life much easier if/when you start introducing Inversion of Control.

2056,What does *exactly* happen during a try catch operation?," Feel free to skip straight to TL/DR if you're not interested in details of the question   A brief preamble: I recently decided to fully re-learn JavaScript from the ground up. This time not only how it works, but also why it works. Everything makes much more sense once you learn also how the compiler works and all the other nitty gritty details, issue is there's this one small pre-built expression:  And I can't quite wrap my head around as to why it works, when it seems to go against all the lexing and scope rules that JS has in place.  The things I don't get: Shouldn't it break the scope? Here we are working only with 2 levels of scope. The scope inside  the scope inside  and the  scope. If we were to illustrate this, it would look something like this:  Now the two inner scopes should act as the two individual scopes and not conflict with each other. With that in mind, **how come that the value of  gets returned to the  block, when it should be enclosed within itself as a scope. I even tried using  to see if I could somehow catch an Exception of trying to pass argument outside of block scope, but even then.. nada, works just as expected:  Technically I created an extra scope here with the ,   unfortunately it's impossible to use strict mode in jsfiddle without   self-invoked function        How come the  block is able to pass an argument to the  block, despite the fact it is conflicting with the ? Seems pretty illogical, when the identifier  should be unique only to it's own scope.  Furthermore, I can't even seem to make sense of it lexically.  The catch blocks calls for a Right Hand Side Lookup of a nonexistent index(?) of the thrown Exception. From where and how does it know where from should it retrieve the Exception?  TL/DR: Probably the easiest way to answer this question would be to answer it in a pseudo-language of a compiler: eg.  Hopefully you get my longwinded post. I know this is more of a theoretical question, but I want to fully comprehend what is happening behind the scenes during the  operation. "," I arrive at the  block and push its location onto a stack of  blocks (will be popped out when the  is reached)* I execute the code inside the block I arrive at a   I evaluate the  as an expression (if it is an identifier i look it up in the current scope) I stored the result of the evaluation in a temporary internal variable I look up the upmost  from the stack and pop it I go to the related  block I create the  in the scope of the catch block, and copy the value of the internal variable to it I execute the catch block I execute the code after the catch block  (Thats very simplified and it even gets a bit more complicated inside of an  function), you can read the whole story at $13.15.7/8 of the ECMA spec.  Shouldn't it break the scope?  The thrown thing doesn't have to be part of s scope at all:  It can also be only part of the expression. If it is however part of the scope as:  Then throwing it will cause it to be copied out of the scope (into some internal variable), the scope will stop existing (as the block stops executing) and it will be copied into a new variable of a new scope:  So there will be two scopes with two variables, but they hold the same value.  *The Spec defines it as a recursive evaluation of blocks, which will then wind up at the  statement until it reaches a Try block, but I think its easier to understand with a stack (which recursion will be at the end).",0.2,0.0012474012474012475,0.6666666666666666,0.2857142857142857,0.0037695633527762796,1,1

I don't know how I can force it to become invalid as soon as the user has logged out. Here are the steps to reproduce this behaviour:  Open Mvc Client and Login to IDSV4  Get the Access token by using  Copy the AccessToken and access the WebApi2 by using that token (it works and we can see the validation step between Api and IDSV4) I Logout from IDSV4 and Client by using the following:  await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(""Cookies""); await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(""oidc"");  If we refresh the web page on Mvc Client, we can see that the user has logged out. Repeat the Step3 and send request to WebApi2 again by using the same AccessToken.  It still works because it doesn't do the token validation again.

You should never call close() method as it will immediately disconnect the client socket and their will be no point executing request further on server as the client request is already processed.

Response stream will be eventually closed by container itself at the end of request processing so you should not worry about calling it manually.

2282,Why does function keep repeating text after I end while loop and exit?,"Problem To reproduce the problem, run this in repl.it and input ""cNOT"" (without the quotation marks) when prompted. After this it should ask about the gates you want for the second qubit, instead, it asks again the same question you gave ""cNOT"" as an answer to. Code  Explanation of code The code is way reduced down, but it's meant to be a simulation of an ideal quantum computer. ""qstat"" is a dictionary of the states of each qubit. It probably doesn't need to be a dictionary, but the way it is in the actual program is nice so I'm keeping it. Anyway, ""qubits"" is the number of qubits in the system and it normally can be any integer the user inputs. The function ""target"" is the target qubit in a cNOT gate. The reason there's the ""try...except"" section is in the code is because sometimes the user will input ""target"" before ""control"" and since the control qubit needs to be checked to determine what to do with the target qubit, outputs a NameError, so I set it up to record that qubit in a list that I'm currently coding to ""recalculate"" each of the qubits in that list. ""done"" is a way of checking that the user's done with each qubit, and since it's in a while loop, I thought setting it to ""y"" after the ""except"" statement would end the while loop and move on to the next qubit, but for some reason it's staying inside the function - the same line is repeated over and over. If you wish to exit the function, you have to type some gibberish, because that corresponds to the last else statement, where if typegat2 doesn't equal ""cNOT"" it returns qstat (which hasn't changed) and moves on. So clearly the function isn't returning anything because of the error, or something. But then the problem becomes, how can I get it to exit the function?  Any help would be appreciated. I would be glad to answer any questions you have on the code; I tried to reduce it as much as possible.","Get rid of the  loop, that's causing the code to repeat whenever the  exception occurs.

What are the main differences and when is used what? ,"A callback is a function that you pass to another function, which will then call that when some async action is done:  You will see this pattern quite often, as everything ilelse relies on callbacks. If you however got many callbacks, the code gets hard to read and to maintain, especially when working with loops. For that, Promises were introduced, which wrap a callback function, and allow to attach callbacks to the Promise. That allows for some nice chaining:  Note that a promise only resolves once, while callbacks can be called multiple times. Events are not really related to Promises, they allow you to attach a callback to an object that will get called when something happens, e.g. a button gets clicked: ",0.2,0.02286902286902287,0.6666666666666666,0.7142857142857142,0.5227545053460433,0,1

2356,Use checkboxes to filter to a new array of objects - javascript,"I have an array of objects:  I want to use checkboxes to filter by ""job"" and then have a new separate array of objects that is filtered (leaving the original array intact). I'd like the new array to update anytime checkboxes change. So if ""teacher"" is checked, you get a new array of first object only. If ""lawyer"" and ""doctor"" are checked simultaneously, then you replace that teacher array with a new array of the second, third, and fourth objects, etc... Here is what I have JSFIDDLE. I have some plain text in there for the places I'm stuck. I'm thinking there needs to be a function that identifies a change in textbox status and pushes to a new array.   Then another function to do the filtering.  For some context, the array will have about 20,000 objects. And I'll need it to be flexible to account for more properties eventually. And ultimately more than one checkbox list so multiple checkbox lists can be used in combination to make this new array.

2357,Rails: How can I implement this relationship between these models? habtm? habtm through? Polymorphic?,"I am storing my files on Amazon s3. Each file has many ""consumers"" and these consumers can be of any type(users, external apps, business_listings, etc).  This calls for a many to many relationship. However, I also want to store certain attributes about each relationship. So I think that the best way to approach this would be to create a *has_and_belngs_to_many_through* relationship between the ""s3_files"" and the consumers The question now is, since there are many type of consumers, I need to use polymorphic associations.  So based on this I would take the following steps:  My confusion lies in the polymorphic part of this relationship.  Since I donot have a ""Consumer"" model. I donot understand how that fits into this equation. I saw some tutorials online and came up with the above method and concept, but, Im uncertain if this si the correct way to approach this problem. Essentially, I understand here that ""Consumers"" is like an interface that all the models ""implement"" and then the S3_file model can associate itself with any model that has ""implemented"" this interface. Question is how and where do the models: users and business_listings ""implement"" this ""Consumer"" interface. How do I set that up?","Whenever you want to store attributes about the relationship between to models in a many-to-many relationship, generally the relationship is :has_many, :through. I'd recommend beginning with this simpler approach and then considering polymorphism later, if you need to. For now, begin with just having a  attribute you can use if you need it. consumer.rb:  resource_relationship.rb:  s3_file.rb  Notice that this simplifies as well the need to have attributes in the  table -- those attributes are really attributes of the  and  models anyway, so it may be best to just keep them there.

I started researching the Gmail API, but either it's too limited to do what I want, or I don't understand how the API works. I only see three ""APIs"" that seem relevant to me: IMAP, SMTP, and Google Apps. (I don't even feel it's correct to call the first two APIs, but whatever, that's what I'm seeing online.) And from my understanding of IMAP/SMTP, it doesn't seem right that a script would transact via IMAP/SMTP; am I mistaken?

2402,Is there a way or technology to implement database resource allocation based on user?,"Typically, when platforms want to provide database resource to user (developer) for applications development, they use limit database access APIs to restrict behaviors of the application, in order to enforce some constraints on resources occupied, an example is social API. Is there a same way that we can implement and use in database layer, nor application layer. If then, we just need to assign database quota for specific user and let database handle the resource usage. Furthermore, it's better to have some programming APIs from database server to support this.

It's necessary to use operating system facilities to achieve what limited prioritization is possible.  But the question to me really is -- no matter which database is used -- what is the expectation when a user exceeds their limits?

2423,Preloading multiple large datasets in the background via ajax?,"I'm developing a web application that is entirely in one page and is based on displaying a bunch of table data in grids.  There are about 30 different tables in the database, any one of which can be requested by the user to display in a grid on their screen at any time.  Most, but not all, of these tables have fewer than 1000 rows.  The data for these grids is being called in and loaded via ajax. Right now, I display the log in screen and immediately preload a few of the main tables, so as the user is typing in their user name and password, it's loading the initial grids. This has really increased user experience since they don't have to wait for an ajax call after clicking to see one of these datagrids.  As a result, I'm thinking of taking it a step farther. I am considering making ajax calls to load all 30 tables in the background.  They won't be added to the dom until needed, but instead into an array.  The negative is I don't know if the user will use half these tables in their session, but the ones they do will normally show immediately upon user request and create a better user experience. So, my questions are, is it a good idea to store 30 full datatables (mostly about 50 to 1000 rows per table) in arrays via ajax calls, and if so, what's the best way to do it to get the best performance (keep in mind I am just putting them in arrays and not adding them to the dom after preloading)?  Which of the following would be the best way:  Make 30 ajax calls for each table on page load Make 1 ajax call on page load that returns all the tables Make like 5 ajax calls on page load that each return like 6 tables Skew the ajax calls so I make a few and then once they complete, make a few more Some other method...

I will need to ensure that I am checking the high score for this correct activity, as well as the correct user. The desired output will look something similar to this (user_id and activity_id will not be null):  The  column is equal to true when the user's score is greater than their highest score for that specific game, thus creating a new improvement. The logic here must only compare the highest score that this specific user has achieved on this specific activity. I am unsure whether the best approach would be using a trigger to automatically check this upon a database insert? The reason I am storing these improvements is because I am hoping to retrieve the amount of records where the improvement is equal to true, and visualize these in a graph. Here is the trigger I've got so far:  However this code is not currently working and provides me with an error: '#1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE user_id = NEW.user_id AND activity_name = NEW.activity_name;' I'm sure there's a lot to work on here, but I would appreciate a brief explanation of how to approach this!","You have a few syntax errors.

Now I need the possibility to reset the buttonset, i.e. to uncheck all buttons at once. Since I don't want a separate reset button for that, I need the reset to happen when you click on an already checked button. To me, this is the most intuitive way to handle these radio buttons.

I would like to have a transformation where given a specific set of Euler angles (x1,y1,z1), if I transform them I would get an Euler sequence of (0,0,0). All other Euler sequences (xi,yi,zi) transformed would then act like (x1,y1,z1) were (0,0,0). Background: I'm using Oculus DK2 HMD to display a virtual environment (Vizard 5, Python 2.7.5) while using a Vicon motion capture system (Nexus 2) to update the position and orientation. I can get the Euler angles of the HMD (from a marker cluster, not the DK2 gyroscope) from the Vicon system, but when facing my desired (0,0,0) orientation the HMD has a non-zero rotation sequence. Problem: I'm having a hard time thinking about what transformation (rotation matrix?) I could find that could take a sequence like (-105, 110, -30) and make it (0,0,0) without being a useless matrix of zeros. If the rotation matrix was all zeros, any sequence would be transformed to (0,0,0)). The formula I have in mind is (please ignore syntax): [0,0,0] = (3x3)R*(3x1)[-105,110,-30]     what is R? R cannot be 3x3 zero matrix. Attempt: I stupidly tried to simply subtract the offest euler angles like so:  Alas,  I'm sure this is possible, in fact I've done similar things in the past where I had to transform marker clusters into a rigid body's frame at a calibration position. But I just can't get around the trivial solution in this case (zeros matrix).

I call this time zero, even though time has little to do with it, really it's the ""home"" orientation. Once the transformation is known, it can be used to determine the view orientation using the data from the hmd, since the coordinate frames of the hmd and view can be thought of as mounted on the same rigid body (meaning their relative transformation will not change with time).

The subset is given by rectangular bounds e.g. row and column delimiters. Since I do not want to code the iteration with 2 for loops over and over again I am considering two approaches to solve this problem: First create a custom iterator provider which is initialized using the rectangle limits and then keeps them while he is iterated. While this is feasible it seems quite some work to make this iterator compliant e.g. with standard stl aglorithms. The second approach is to pass a function pointer into the function the traverses both for loops and execute it in the inner loop. This is feasible as well but might create quite ugly syntax since i have to pass member functions. Which way is usually preferable ? And are there any clean examples for such a use case, to keep me from reinventing the wheel ?

If you have a handler for an element that's between the target and the container, and it calls , that stops the event from bubbling any further. So the event never reaches the container, and the delegation fails.

As to the proposed approach in https://hendrikvanb.gitlab.io/2018/07/nested_data-json_to_tibble/: I might be  overlooking something obvious, but I think it only works for JSON docs with a single document. First, let's modify  (see Hendrik's answer below) to only turn ""leaf"" data frames into tibbles while turning ""branch"" data frames into lists:  This would give us results that are in line with the proposed way in the blog post, but only for ""single object"" JSON docs as illustrated below  Transforming :  Transforming :  As we see, ""listifying"" nested JSON structures actually may results in copying the ""leafs"".

Still, I do believe there is a way to achieve what you're after (whether or not this is a particularly good idea is less clear) by leveraging three functions from the  package in combination:   allows us to get the (nesting) depth of a given list,  allows us to apply a function to an list at the specified  level of depth, and  allows us to iteratively apply a function and have the result of each iteration be passed as the input to the subsequent iteration.  General approach In essence, we want to convert any  found at any level in the list to a . This can easily be achieved using several rounds of  where we simply alter the depth depending on the level of the list we wish to target.  Crucially, however, we want to do this in a way so that changes to level 1, for example, are retained when we move on to targeting level 2; changes to level 1 and 2 are retained when we move on to level 3; and so on.  This is where  comes in: each time we apply  to convert a data.frame to a tibble, we'll ensure that the resultant output gets passed as the input to the next iteration.  This is illustrated in the MWE below MWE Start with the basic setup of data structures and libraries  Now we'll create a simple helper function that can conditionally convert  to   Now for the crucial routine: Taking  as the initial starting point (), apply the  function at each level of  () using .

2746,Weird output when using fork(),"I am trying to create a time-based pool: you either give an answer to all the questions or the time's up. My original logic was to get a child to count and the parent to ask questions, but I failed to implement that. Thus, I decided to create 2 children and let the parent orchestrate their behavior. The first child counts the time, while the second child asks the questions. It seems to be working, except at the end of the program, the remaining questions get printed as well, which is kinda weird.

In your case, the  child that does the countdown finishes first, so the child that prints the questions keeps running after the parent process exits.  Meanwhile, the shell is only waiting for the parent process. When it exits, the shell prints the next prompt. That's why you see questions printed after the prompt.

2749,Load spark data into Mongo / Memcached for use by a Webservice,"I am extremely new to spark and have a specific workflow associated question. Although it is not really a coding related question, it is more a spark functionality related question and I thought it would be appropriate here. Please feel free to redirect me to the correct site if you think this question is inappropriate for SO. So here goes:   1. I am planning to consume a stream of requests using Spark's Sliding Window functionality and calculate a recommendation model. Once the model is calculated, would it be possible for a web-service to query and consume this data directly from an RDD? If so could anyone point me toward some example code of how this can be achieved?  If not, I would like to store the data in memcached as the data that I am storing is currently not too large, it is mostly for the in-memory iterative calculation and streaming support purposes that I am using Spark, so is it possible to load RDD data into memcached? I'm asking because I could only find a Mongo connector for Spark and couldn't find a Memcached connector.  Any help and especially specific code examples/ links would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.","You can't query an RDD directly in this way. Think of your Spark job as a stream processor. What you can do is push the updated model to some ""store"", such as a database (with a custom API or JDBC), a file system, or memcached. You could even make a web service call from within the Spark code. Whatever you do, be careful that the time to process each batch of data, including I/O, is well under the interval time you specify. Otherwise, you risk bottlenecks that might eventually crash. One other thing to watch for is the case where you have your model data in more than one RDD partition spread over the cluster, (which is the default of course). If the order of your ""records"" doesn't matter, then writing them out in parallel is fine.

This says, in very simplified pseudocode:  After this would follow some else ifs for the case that demand is lower than supply. But what I get are two new entries.

Because when there is no other recent supply I must insert the rest of the candy demand into the table. But not showing every single step, but the final result. Now how can I do this?

All data being stored is strings. The cache file doesn't store any other type of data. I've put together a basic function but I'm having trouble getting it functioning;  Notes  is a different function that returns the description data based on the . The warnings I'm getting are  in both  and , on lines 4 and lines 9 respectively (those are the line numbers in the above code - due to the nature of my script these numbers are later on) -- for simplicity, I've marked the problem lines with . The function is running in a loop which I've no problems with. The problems lie within this function. What currently happens Right now, if the cache doesn't exist, it creates it and adds the first item from the loop to the cache file in it's respective JSON format (that fires since the cache file doesn't exist, so after the final  statement). However, items from the loop after that don't get added, presumably because the file exists and there's something wrong with the code. The last part of the function works exactly as I want it to but the first part does not. Expected behaviour with fixed code Check cache > Return description if item exists ELSE add new item to cache. The items and their associated descriptions will NOT change, but I'm pulling them from a rate limited API, and I need to ensure I cache whatever I can for everyones benefit.

In particular I found this very helpful:   Knuth takes advantage of a basic principle of doubly-linked lists.   When removing an object from a list, only two operations are needed: x.getRight().setLeft( x.getLeft() )   x.getLeft().setRight(> x.getRight() )  However, when putting the object back in the list, all   is needed is to do the reverse of the operation. x.getRight().setLeft( x )   x.getLeft().setRight( x )  All that is   needed to put the object back is the object itself, because the object   still points to elements within the list. Unless x’s pointers are   changed, this operation is very simple.   To implement it I added setters for linking / unlinking. See comments:   ",0.2,0.02286902286902287,1.0,0.7142857142857142,1.0,1,1

When inserting, if breaking a certain limit, the container will rehash to use more buckets, so each bucket is less full and faster to search. And that invalidates the iterators. This means I shouldn't keep iterators to an  container. Except I can, if I update them after a rehash. But I couldn't find a reliable way to check whether an  (be it  or whatever) caused a rehash. Should I monitor ? cppreference says . Is that garanteed? Would it be reliable to do the following? ","I don't think that re-hashing (as the process where actually a hash function is engaged) takes place once hash-map is growing:  calculating a hash is (relatively) computationally expensive see below my example I quickly compiled, where I crafted a custom hash functor, which keeps track of times it is called:   whenever bucket count increases, there's no indication that hash function was called => we can infer that re-bucketing takes place instead of re-hashing   That means, that one may watch over bucket count to infer whether iterator should be invalidated (predicated the invalidation happens at the moment of re-bucketing)  Output:  Disclaimer: though, I strongly believe that it's not a good programming practice to refer iterators after the container has changed in size. Even if it might not cause some fatal / undefined behaviors, it might (and most likely will) cause some side effects onto the programming logic. In case with the hash-map, consider a situation with a  iterator: after a few insertions/emplacements it won't be a true  anymore.

2893,"Does the MongoDB ""extent was empty"" indicate a missing index?",I have seen a lot of questions about the MongoDB log entry such as  I know this is because there is allocated empty space in the MongoDB datafiles caused by deleting previous data. Commenters usually say you can ignore this message or compact the DB if you want to recover the diskspace. But why is MongoDB looking in an empty spot anyway? Does this message also indicate that I am missing an index and that the DB is scanning the datafiles?,"The message you are receiving can happen after a large amount of data is deleted. An extent is just a data file, or ""bucket"" where data can be stored. If you delete a lot of data an extent can end up empty. This is not a problem as the extent will get filled up again as data is inserted.  Does this message also indicate that I am missing an index and that the DB is scanning the datafiles?  No, this is just an informational message logged periodically when MongoDB finds an empty extent. As you mentioned, the message can be ignored or you can address it by running a repair to free up allocated space. If your collection has frequent deletions or document growth, you should also consider enabling the usePowerOf2Sizes collection allocation option. This allocation strategy will allow MongoDB to more effectively reuse deleted space by allocation records by rounding up to the nearest power of 2 (rather than using a dynamic Padding Factor. FYI, PowerOf2Sizes is now the default allocation strategy for new collections in MongoDB 2.6. Note that usePowerOf2Sizes only affects new record allocations once the flag is enabled.

I'm already using a ""Workflow"" sheet as a very light log (mains sub) readable by the user. But I'd like to log what is currently printed in the Immediate Window by , which can generate a lot since it's much more comprehensive log. I'm thus considering something like :  How should I use the  and  commands ? Open / Append / Close for each line, as necessary Something like :     Much simpler to implement, but I'm concerned about the performance of opening/closing the file 1000's times. Open at the beginning of the Main sub / Append as necessary / Close at the end of the Main sub Something like :   How would you check if the file is already open before trying to log ? (Some subs can be launch directly by a button, or recursively by a main sub) Can I  a second file (my macro also need to output data to csv files) while file n°1 is still open ? Will keeping the file open have a big impact on memory (assuming 100 000 lines in the files) ? ","There is no problem opening more than one file at a time. Just make sure your file numbers are different and you don't confuse them. Your first method, opening the file, appending to it, and closing with each call to log_to_file can be a useful way to do it, especially if you're concerned about losing logging data if the program crashes or is externally terminated. If you do buffer the output, as Tim Williams suggested, you would lose what's in the buffer at the moment of the crash/termination. There will be some performance cost, but how much depends on a number of factors, like the configuration of the computer system, what type of drive the log file is located on, etc. It may be worth trying to see what sort of performance hit you take. (One test is worth a thousand expert opinions...) The other approach, where you open the log file at the start and close it at the end is also a good approach. As Tim suggested, just create a global boolean variable, something like and add a check to the log_to_file sub.  A detail this leaves hanging is the need to close the log file at some point. By setting log_file_open to false as part of the Close_log_file sub, you could do this more than once through the course of running the program. But you would need to do it at least once, after all of the Log_to_file calls. One final note: By always opening the log file in append mode, the file will grow each time the program is run. Depending on the situation, this may be acceptable, or you may have to include some code to keep the log file from becoming huge. Some possible solutions:  Give the log file a name based on the date. This results in many smaller log files. You could also delete log files with dates that are too old, keeping the total number in check. Write code to delete the oldest (topmost) lines in the file once the file gets too large. This is very possible, but not trivial. The first time you open the log file during a particular run of the program, delete the existing log file first. You end up with a log file that only includes the logging of the last program run.

SQL Fiddle prepared tables Brief Explanation of each field c_id = coach id, cName = coach name, e_id = equipment id, eName = name of the equipment, termUsed = number of terms the equipment has been used for so far, sports = which sport they teach (some teach multiple) The sport table is normalized where there are single fields for each single sport that they teach. Some coaches only teach one sport and some teach multiple sports. I was advised to normalize the data, according to other posts I've seen on StakOverFlow.

This only solves one part of the problem, as it matches the coaches with a common sport that they teach, BUT it does not also match the equipment (which is owned by individual coaches) based on the number of terms they were used for. the goal the point of this project, is to match coaches (who bought their own equipment) within a community centre, to trade equipment (that has been worn out equally) based off a common sport. keep in mind this is in a low-income community, so we don't have much of a budget to work with. so i am creating this database as a solution to cut costs and be more resourceful. Also to help coaches gain equipment equally worn out... so that nobody gets older equipment than what they traded. we are poor..so we try to be resourceful. a volleyball can also be used as a soccer ball to teach the kids. this isn't a professional team, its a community center outreach program for kids in low income areas. i have been warned for making low quality posts before. i have read the necessary documents and have tried to follow all the rules and guidelines when posting to the best of my capabilities. i also have searched for a week before making this post to find answers.

3027,Calling the ARPACK reverse communicated matrix-vector routine,"I'm trying to write a driver in C++ to calculate the eigenvalues for an asymmetric, real-valued sparse matrix using the fortran functions offered by ARPACK, but I am having a bit of trouble with the reverse communication approach.  Generally, I am trying to solve the normal eigenvalue equation:  and any interaction with the matrix A is done in ARPACK via a function 'av':  which multiplies the vector held in the array 'workd' beginning at location 'ipntr[0]' and inserts the result into the array 'workd' beginning at location 'ipntr[1]'. Examples of this approach are given in the manual at http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/ and also in the ARPACK/EXAMPLES/SIMPLE/dnsimp.f code. What I would like to know is how do I actually involve the matrix A? If it is not passed to the routine then how is it possible to find its action on the vector provided? In the example code dnsimp.f their matrix A is calculated within the function 'av', and is 'derived from the standard central difference discretisation of the 2 dimensional convection-diffusion operator'. However, I believe this is problem specific? It also doesn't seem too useful to have to code the derivation of the matrix A into the function. I can't find much information on this from the manual either. It doesn't seem to be too much of a problem, since as it is a user defined function I am able to just change the definition of 'av' to include the matrix A as a parameter. However I would like to know how it is done properly in case of any potential compatibility issues.  Thank you!","You don't have to supply the matrix to ARPACK. All you have to do, is to multiply the matrix with the returned vectors (thus, reverse communication) till the desired convergence is reached. For information on the algorithms, you should take a look at the users guide and especially on the chapter about the underlying algorithms. Response to comment: The underlying algorithm is a form of Arnoldi Iteration. The basic algorithm is shown in wikipedia and shows, that the matrix A won't be accessed. Neither directly, nor indirectly. In particular, the algorithms starts with an arbitrary normalized vector q_1. This vector is returned to the user. The user multiplies this vector with the matrix A using their favourite routine (usually some efficient sparse matrix-vector-multiplication) and returns the result to the Arnoldi Iteration to calculate a part of the Hessenberg matrix H (whose eigenvalues typically converge to the extreme eigenvalues of A) and the next vector q_2. This has to be iterated, till your results are converged.",0.4,0.01496881496881497,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,0

Thank you,"In answer to your first question: it depends on when you're creating the session. If sessions are only used for logged in users or if that's the only use case that you want to protect then putting this logic into an  would work best. This involves extending  and adding in the above logic; then in your  adding the entry under the  parameter (see the reference documentation) for this. If you want to protect all sessions, then extending your session handler and putting this code in its initialisation or save methods would probably be the best - I'm not familiar with the Redis session handler class so couldn't advised more than this. Once you've extended the session handler, just configure Symfony to use your session handler with its added logic. As for your second question: checking IP address like this has its own foibles for connections that don't stay on the same IP address between requests e.g. corporations that load balance their internet connections and don't thread them for web requests. Realistically if you've turned off obtaining the session ID from URLs which is the main vector for session hijacking, then really this is, in my opinion, overkill. I guess it depends on what you're securing and the impact this would have on it. Far better would be to have SSL throughout, HSTS enabled and secure cookies on and forget about trying to mitigate at this level.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.5227545053460433,1,1

I have a basic function for running shell commands and retrieving the output:  I use this command in a loop:  HashSize() takes the string hash and counts the leading zeros by iterating over each character until a non-zero character is found, counting the total binary zeros.  The HashGenerator() function uses the generic shell command function above to activate a python script:  Obviously, the data for the script is taken from the shell command. This all works fine, but is very slow (data is incremented from 0 to roughly ~18,000 in a few hours).  Now, my actual implementation of this is a bit more complicated, but I suspect the system call to Python is what is causing the problems here. What is the overhead for this process?  Do you agree that this is where my problem is?  Is there a way I can speed up this procedure? I want this question to be useful for others, so I want to avoid being overly hardware specific; however, I should mention that this is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which isn't known for breaking computational records.  I would still expect it to go faster than this, though.","The overhead is the following:   - It creates a pipe (low overhead) and starts a  process (relatively expensive)  - Parses the command line (low overhead) and starts a  process (relatively expensive)  - Parses and compiles the Python script (somewhat expensive) and executes the script.  The 2nd and 3rd steps are the same as if you run the Python script by hand from the terminal. Starting up lots of processes in a loop is generally not a good idea. If you can't do the calculation in C++, a better way to do it would be to set up bi-directional communication with the Python process, send it an input and then read the result for that.

3400,Usage of dup2()," According to the book Advanced Programming in the UNIX environment, the if statement above is necessary. The book suggests to work through it by considering what would happen if fd = 1 in one case, and if fd = 3 in another. If fd = 1, 0 (stdin) would be closed and then would point at stdout, 1 would still point at stdout (since dup2() doesn't close a file descriptor if it's equal to the first argument, and will return 1) and 2 would point at stdout. If fd = 3, every file descriptor would be first closed and then point at whatever file 3 points at. Why is it necessary to close the descriptor if it's greater than 2?","You don't want to leave any unused file descriptors open. After you redirect , , and  to , you're not planning on using  by itself -- it was just opened temporarily so that you could then duplicate all the standard descriptors to it. So you need to close it. But you don't want to close it if it's actually the same as , , or  (this should be unlikely, but it's possible if one of them was already closed before you opened ). So you need the  to prevent that. As to why it's important to close the original descriptor, some types of streams do something special (and often important) only when all of the descriptors referring to it are closed. For instance, a TCP connection will not be closed until all the descriptors are closed, a deleted file will only have its data removed from disk when all links are removed and all descriptors are closed, and the read end of a pipe only receives EOF when all the descriptors referring to the write end are closed. So if you leave  open, and later close the standard descriptors, it will prevent this final action from occurring. A very common situation where you need to close a descriptor is when you create a pipe to communicate with a child process. The code generally looks something like:  The child needs to close the write end of the pipe (), otherwise the child won't receive EOF when the parent closes it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1

3402,What are the best practices for preventing SQL creep?,"I have a webapp written in PHP using a MySQL database backend. This question could just as easily apply to any language and application trying to use an SQL database and MVC OOP design. How do you keep your SQL code restricted to the Model? There's a rather longer story specific to my case behind the question.  As previously mentioned I'm working on a PHP/MySQL/AJAX website.  I designed it using OOP and MVC design principles - with a Model, View and Controller.  I managed to keep the view elements - such as markup and styling - restricted completely to the View and to make them reusable fairly easily.  I thought I had done the same with SQL code.  But as work has progressed, it's become pretty clear that the Model needs some serious refactoring. The way I'd found to keep the SQL in the Model was to encapsulate every single SQL query in its own Query object.  And then when I needed to call some SQL in the View or Controller I would access the query through a factory.  No SQL code exists in the Controller or the View. But this has become extraordinarily tedious.  I don't think I'm actually gaining anything by doing this and am spending far too much time creating queries with names like ""SelectIdsFromTableWhereUser"".  The factory for the queries is approaching thousands of lines.  A bit of searching in Eclipse has revealed that the vast majority of these queries are used in one or two places and never again.  Not good. I know that in good MVC you want to keep the SQL completely separate from the Controller or the View.  But at this point, it seems to me like it would have been better to just place the SQL where it was needed in the code and not bother trying to bury it and database code deep in the Model.  These queries are only being used once, why bother encapsulating them?   Is it that important to keep the SQL separate from Controller or the View?  What is gained by doing this?  What is lost by allowing it to spread?  How do you solve this problem? Edit Per request, here's a little more detail on my model. There are two portions to it.  The Tables portion and the Queries portion.  The Tables portion holds the domain objects - mostly designed as wrappers around class objects that are exact analogues of the tables in the database.  For example, there might be a database table  that has fields , , and .  There will be a Table object () that has an array with fields 'id', 'name' and 'type'.  It would look like this:  If there's a  database table that has a one to many relation (one  many ) with fields , , and  then there will be a  Table object () which will look pretty much exactly the same as the above . The  and many  objects will both be contained in the  object.  Give the  object factory an id to a  table and it populates itself with 's data and all of its s and their data.      The Query objects are used for pulling out those  ids in the order they are needed.  So, if I want the  objects ordered by date, vote or name, I need a different query object to do it.  Or if I want to select all  objects that have a  in a certain range.  I need a query object. Most of the time I use the Table objects (the wrappers, not the base tables) to interact with the database.  But when it comes to selecting which table objects, that's where the queries come in. During original design I didn't think there would be too many queries and I thought they were going to be things that would see reuse.  Since there might be several places where I'd want the s in date order.  But it hasn't worked out that way.  There are way more of them than anticipated and most of them are one offs, used once in some View or Command and then never again.  I also thought the queries might encapsulate fairly complex SQL and it would be good to have them as objects so that I would always be sure to give them the data they needed and it would be a relatively sanitized environment in which to test the SQL query itself.  But again, it didn't work out that way.  Most of them contain pretty simple SQL.","To start with the last question : what is gained is separation of concerns or in plain english ""Keeping things together which belong together"".  A key word here is belong, which is a rather subjective word.  In the early PHP days a lot of people found that whatever is on a single page ""belongs"" together. Since PHP used to be an acronym for ""Personal Home Page"" its design goal was small sites with a couple of pages and then this sense of belonging makes absolute sense. When things grow, the sense of belonging shifts. When we get a complex data model which needs to be kept consistent and which must evolve over time, then suddenly the operations on this ""model"" start to ""belong"" together because it becomes too difficult to dig out the operations and SQL queries all over the place. So in order to keep control we need all model operations on the same page.  As a practical approach I like to draw a line in the sand between the UI and the Model and define a API there which encapsulates the mini user goals (User wants to see the promotions --> getPromotions methods is needed, User wants to add something to the cart : addToCart method is needed, etc...).  I like to draw the line here, because it captures the User's desires, the UI's responsibility is to make the user get there in an easy and effective way, the service/model/repository layer responsibility is to realise that desire. If done properly, it is also on a level 1 step removed from the User. Many developers however confuse what the User wants with the features that need to be implemented. Then you get very ineffective service methods like saveProject (A User does not want the project to be saved, she just wants it to be there next time she logs in. It is taken for granted, and as such it has no place in the service API). This implementation based API leads to layers of almost empty wrapper methods. Things like repositories etc, are a way to structure this service layer. This user-goal oriented API approach also has the tendency to clean up the views (the content of the display elements can be fetched with a handful service calls) and the controllers (an action then consists of the normal sanitizing and typically a single method call).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0

Back to the shared code, since the manager is optional (otherwise this discussion wouldn't even be a discussion), we have something like:  It would be nice to check on all products if there's a manager available, without having to enforce that naming convention. The Question Is there a way to find an instance of ""Manager"" without iterating over the whole global scope? A one-liner to say, ""Give me the first (or all) instance(s) of Manager""?

However it difficult for me to add a mongoose query to the if statement as I get alot of errors. The JSON Approach Using this approach, I cache the mongoDB collection to a JSON file, the attempt to read off the ids. I have a mods.json file which looks like this (Array Of Objects):  The JSON file above contains a list of users who are allowed to execute a certain Telegram Bot command.  A brief explanation of how the above is supposed to work: When the bot receives a ""/test"" command it is supposed to check if the message is from the owner whose id is stored in the config.json file or any moderator whose unique id is stored in the mods.json file.   The problem The following code checks through every single id to confirm whether the message is from a mod. And subsequently spits out multiple messages of 'You are not a mod'. Which would be the best method to confirm the user is a mod in the conditional statement 'if'. The Mongo Approach When querying with moongose a callback is required, I dont know exactly how to create a if conditional in such a scenario. However this method would obviously be better in such a situation.","You could use  instead, to check if the ID is in the array, that way the message won't be outputted on every iteration, only when it's done checking  Preferably you'd construct a query to ask the database instead, something like ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1

I was wondering is there any scenarios where using the  loop approach is a better option than using ? Maybe there are edge cases that the  option does not cover? ","This weird transpilation is a side effect of the biased optimization older versions of V8 had (and might still have). They optimize(d) some certain patterns greatly but did not care about the overall performance, therefore some strange patterns (like a  loop to copy  into an array *) did run way faster. Therefore the maintainers of libraries & transpilers started searching for ways to optimize their code acording to that, as their code runs on millions of devices and every millisecond counts. Now as the optimizations in V8 got more mature and are focused on the average performance, most of these tricks don't work anymore. It is a matter of time till they get refactored out of the codebase. Additionally JavaScript is moving towards a language that can be optimized more easily, older features like  are replaced with newer ones (rest properties) that are more strict, and therefore more performant. Use them to achieve good performance with good looking code,  is a mistake of the past.  I was wondering is there any scenarios where using the for loop approach is a better option than using Array.prototype.slice?  Well it is faster on older V8 versions, wether that is still the case has to be tested. If you write the code for your project I would always choose the more elegant solution, the millisecond you might theoretically loose doesn't matter in 99% of the cases.  Maybe there are edge cases that the slice option does not cover?  No (AFAIK).  *you might ask ""why is it faster though?"", well that's because:  itself is hard to optimize as 1) it can be reassigned () 2) it has to be ""live"", changing arguments will get reflected to  Therefore it can only be optimized if you directly access it, as the compiler then might replace the arraylike accessor with a variable reference:  This also works for loops if you inline them and fall back to another (maybe slower) version if the number of arguments changes:  Now if you however call another function and pass in  things get really complicated:  This can't be really optimized, it is a performance nighmare.

Anyway, as Last Rose Studios says, you can use the column-break property on the image to force the image to be on the top of the second column always, as shown on this fiddle. However, this is a valid solution for webkit only, as firefox doesn't support  property yet afaik. Taking this and the fact that the layout has fixed width and height into consideration, I think the best solution is just making two divs acting as columns as in this fiddle.

As far as I can tell, it's perfectly fine syntax; IE8 doesn't complain, nor does Chrome. The only potential issue I can see is that the  statement isn't in curly braces, but they're optional; I tried adding them, and it didn't resolve the error. Is this a bug in IE7? UPDATE: I removed everything but this function definition from the page, to ensure that it's not related to one of the many other scripts that it loads. The error still occurred. I removed everything but the  line, the error went away. I added back the next line, the error returned. The interesting thing is that the second line gets an expected error: there's no  element on the page (even before I removed all the HTML), so it correctly complains that . I've asked our marketing person to let the advertiser know about this problem. So could this logic error be causing IE7 to think there's a syntax error on the preceding line? I added a  element to the page, and the syntax error went away as well. Then I added back the rest of the function. The second  assignment also references a nonexistent ID. This caused it to report the preceding  line as a syntax error! I think that confirms that this is a weird IE7 bug.","This seems to be an error reporting bug in IE7.

I have tried using a while statement to log the number while lastBall is equal to ""Rolling in 25.06"" (This is the text that's displayed when there's 25.06 seconds remaining before the wheel spins)  } This only returned ""undefined"" in the console.  I'm assuming that a while statement won't work for what I'm trying to do.  Apparently a setInterval would work somehow, but I'm not sure exactly what code I need to paste into console in order to get this to work.   So in summary, I'm trying to log ""1234"" into console if the text of lastBall is equal to ""Rolling in 25.06"".

Another interesting thing is I am able to click through all of the links and see the headers the first time, when I click on the link again the header goes away (ex. I click products > classes > gallery > contact > classes... I will not see the text in the header again). Through looking at into the Developer tools I see the property is set to null.

Thanks!!","The concept of a ""singleton class"" comes from languages that just have classes (Java for example), JavaScript however has much more than classes (objects, functions, ""global code""), and therefore we don't need to mimic a singular object creation with a fake class, we can just do:  You are right that it is possible to create a ""singleton class"", but that has no benefits, it just adds boilerplate, and, in my eyes, makes the code harder to follow (as I'd expect  to create an instance, and not to return a singleton). To check wether an instance comes from a class that is written in your ""singleton pattern way"", you could simply check for the instance:  But I'm not sure wether that is useful at all. It's questionable wether you actually need those classes, and if you really need those, then you probably only have a few of them, and it would be way less error prone to check wether the instance is  one of them:  If your ""singleton class""es are not written by you, and you only know that they come from a constructor function that might return existing instances, then the only way would be to create a new instance of that class, and check wether the same instance was returned:  If the constructor however requires arguments then that will break, or if it's just a regular class instance you will create an unneccessary instance, which might cause unwanted side effects.

Suppose there is a 2D matrix like this:  ..... And I need to calculate the gradient of this thing. Therefore, for each number, I'll need the number as well as all its 4 nearest neighbors of this 2D matrix. Besides the first and last row and column are 0. Now I have two method:  Make such a NxN matrix directly and calculate the gradient. Exactly follow the description. Here the memory use is NxNxreal*8, The loop start from calculating the (2,2) element then (2,3), ...  Make a (N-2)x(N-2)+1 array, and a NxN pointer matrix (use type at the moment). the (N-2)x(N-2) elements of the array will store the numbers except the 0.0s on the border. The last element of the is 0.0. For the pointer matrix,   all the elements on the boarder will point to the last element of the array, 0.0. Other pointers should point to the places where they suppose to point to.   Here comes a issue of performance since the matrix that I am handling can be really huge or maybe 3D. For method 1, there is nothing to say since it is just a straight forward method.  For method 2, I am wondering if the compiler can handle the issue properly. Since each FORTRAN pointer is like a structure according to my understanding so far. IF that is the case, FORTRAN pointer is slower than c pointer since it is not just a simple de-reference? I am also wondering if the type warp of the pointer decrease the performance (that warp is needed to make a pointer matrix). Is ther a particular reason that I should give up method 2 since it should be slower? Let's take IVF on windows, gfortran and ifort on Linux for example. Since it can be compiler dependent. UPDATE: Appreciate Stefan's code. I wrote on by my self as well.  result (o0): pointer, time cost=    2.170000 direct, time cost=    1.127000 result (o2): pointer, time cost=   0.5110000 direct, time cost=   9.4999999E-02 So FORTRAN pointer is much slower. Stefan has pointed that out earlier. Now I am wondering if there is room for improvement. As I know so far, if I did it with c, the difference should not be this much.

3854,Do squashed commits conflict with their original commits,"Would the following scenario produce conflicts, that require manual resolution?  You submit a feature branch for PR, containing commits D, E.  While the PR is being reviewed, you continue working on that same feature branch locally, and add more commits F, G, H. At some point, the PR is approved and merged into master. Commits D/E on master have been replaced with commit X due to squashing. You now have a local branch containing commits D, E, F, G, H, and a master branch containing commit X. You want to merge commits F/G/H into master. So you try to merge your local branch (containing D/E/F/G/H) into master (containing X).  Commits D/E and X touch the exact same lines of code, but have different commit IDs. If D/E is looked at together and compared with X, they are identical. But if D is looked at in isolation and compared with X, there are many differences between them, on commonly modified lines. Is git smart enough to merge {D/E - X} without any merge conflicts? Or would the above produce a number of conflicts needing manual intervention?","I ran some git experiments locally, replicating the workflow steps described in the question. Unfortunately, the answer seems to be yes. Using git squash will result in many merge conflicts, if you're not very careful of what you're doing. I've written about this extensively in this blog post.  The problem described above wouldn't have occurred if you did a naive merge, without any squashing. In that case, after the merge, both master and your local branch would contain commits D-E. Hence, the next time you try to merge your local D-E-F-G-H branch, git would simply execute the merge by applying F-G-H on top of master. However, because we did the squash, this ends up confusing git. Instead of simply applying F-G-H on top of X, it instead tries to merge D-E-F-G-H together with X. Unfortunately, because commits F-G-H modify the same lines of code that are also modified by X, the resulting diff fails with a merge conflict. Some potential ways to resolve this problem:  Brute force: Suck it up and resolve all the conflicts manually. Once you've submitted a pull-request, do not develop any additional commits on top of the commits that are contained in the pull-request. Those commits in the pull-request are going to disappear, from git's perspective, so you don't want to depend on them. Unfortunately, this means that any refinements you want to do on top of what you had just submitted, will need to wait until your pull-request has been approved and merged. If you've made refinements on top of an earlier pull-request, do not allow the earlier pull-request to get merged. Instead, submit a new pull-request with your updated branch, or overwrite the existing pull-request with all the refinements you've made. Unfortunately, this makes the pull-request process an all-or-nothing affair. Ideally, you might like to have the initial pull-request, and the additional refinements, to be approved/merged incrementally. Instead, to prevent the conflicts, you would have to force yourself to merge the whole thing in one shot, or not merge anything at all. Suppose your earlier PR was merged, and you have new refinements that you now want to merge into master as well. Instead of trying to merge your entire branch into master, cherry-pick the incremental commits that you had created, and merge only those cherry-picked commits. So in the example given above, instead of trying to merge D-E-F-G-H into X, cherry pick commits F-G-H, apply them on top of X, and then create a pull-request with your resulting branch. This works well, avoiding all conflicts, and allowing you to do your dev work at any time/pace that you desire. Unfortunately, this also requires you to manually keep track of the fact that D-E == X, and that later commits F-G-H need to be manually cherry-picked and applied. This requires more time and cognitive effort on your part, and it's also easy to mess up this step by either cherry-picking too many commits (and producing conflicts anyway), or cherry-picking too few commits (and missing important changes). Avoid using github's squash-on-megre functionality. Either squash all commits yourself locally, prior to submitting a pull-request. Or merge the pull-request without any squashing at all. This is the status-quo for most projects, with all the benefits/downsides that come with it.  As you can see, there is a real problem/cost associated with squashing all commits prior to merging, and none of the above solutions are perfect. I'm not sure which of the above is the least of all evils.

As I mentioned that this is a huge potential risk we talked about hashing the passwords (not that this is a full solution since it's possible to ""de-hash"" relatively easily these days) and I've come across a question that I think I might know the answer but I want to be 100% sure. This client developed a couple desktop applications that require the user to insert their user/password, all in plain-text of course. So, if we hashed the passwords by updating each password field to its MD5 (for example) hash, would modifying the desktop apps to perform this hash on the password received/input and then compare them (and login) work? Basically, do the login procedure as it's always been but use hashed passwords instead, being this a transparent and unnoticeable operation to the users?","Yes, this will work and should be transparent to the users. However, it's not very secure. If someone gets a copy of the login database, they'll get the hashed passwords. And since you're sending hashed passwords over the wire, that's all they need to know -- they don't need to unhash it. It's better to send the plaintext password over the wire, and do the hashing in the server application or database query, e.g.  See Encryption and Compression Functions for the encryption functions available with MySQL. This way, if someone gets your user database, they'll need to decrypt the passwords for them to be useful to break into your application. Either way, you should make sure the passwords are transmitted over encrypted connections (e.g. SSL).

But I need to see who originated the newProcess send. When I click over the method in the debugger method list, the stack does not expand as usually does showing the callers. Is this possible in Pharo?",Short answer: no. A new process doesn't have any history from before its conception. Slightly longer answer: if you're willing to do a little work you can embed a reference to the caller process in the new process by using the normal closure creation. Here's an example:  Note that this will not enhance your debugging experience since the debugger doesn't know that you have that reference. To do this you need to extend the stack of your current process (variant of the above):  Be very careful when manipulating the context chain like this.

4237,"console.log/warn/error - native, vanilla JavaScript more performant alternative?","I have done a bit of research and most of what I find is a good few years old. I’m new to JS and I’m building up my knowledge gradually. Console.log() is an incredibly helpful tool, however I’m incredibly wary of its generally poor performance (https://jsperf.com/console-log1337/16 or https://jsperf.com/console-log1337/33 as a basic example), as well as bad reputation. In the event I need to leave console.log() style error messages in a production application/website, is there a more performant alternative that is native to vanilla JS (no frameworks/libraries)? My initial thought was to instead push all log items into an array which could later be collected (if required) however it seems that doesn’t work in conjunction with Promise.all() very well - rather than getting say, 10 items in an array, I instead get back either a single array with the last value, or 10 separate arrays. Is there a native or most recommended alternative (appreciate this is open to “opinion” - I’m not sure how else to word it!)? Ps - apologies for lack of formatting... mobile!"," ... poor performance  One of the testcases compares calling an empty function to calling .

4337,"Common table references, Int or String identifier?","I was wondering how to take the best way to solve this situation. It's a database structure problem... Let's see the case. I have some databases which have the same structure (let's say db_A, db_B, db_C). They are identical in structure but with different data, of course. There's another database with permissions (db_permissions), and another with users (db_users). The db_permissions structure table would be ID, permission; where permission is a unique string identifier (like post:create). Now, there's a user which has different permissions on each table. For example: user 123 would have rights to write a post in db_A, rights to only read posts on db_B, and rights to read, write and delete posts on db_C.  My question is, how should I reference the permissions on each table?   Do I reference the unique string identifier (like post:create, post:read) and add this directly to each database permissions (like user_id - permission_string)? Or do I reference them by the ID primary key on the permissions database (like user_id - permission_id)?  In my PHP script, when I check the permissions, I check by the unique string identifier.  What would you recommend? Would you use another structure for the permissions?

4339,"Map database column1, column2, columnN to a collection of elements","In legacy database tables we have numbered columns like C1, C2, C3, C100 or M1, M2, M3, M100. This columns represent BLOB data. It is not possible to change anything it this database. By using JPA Embeddable we map all of the columns to single fields. And then during embedding we override names by using 100 override annotations. Recently we have switched to Hibernate and I've found things like UserCollectionType and CompositeUserType. But I hadn't found any use cases that are close to mine. Is it possible to implement some user type by using Hibernate to be able to map a bundle of columns to a collection without additional querying?  Edit: As you probably noticed the names of columns can differ from table to table. I want to create one type like ""LegacyArray"" with no need to specify all of the @Columns each time I use this type. But instead I'd use  ","I can think of a couple of ways that I would do this. 1. Create views for the collection information that simulates a normalized table structure, and map it to Hibernate as a collection: Assuming your existing table is called , I would create a view that's similar to the following:  Now from Hibernate's perspective,  is just a normalized table that has a foreign key to . Mapping this should be pretty straight forward, and is covered here:  http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html/collections.html  The benefits of this approach:  From Hibernate's point of view, the tables are normalized, it's a fairly simple mapping No updates to your existing tables  The drawbacks:  Data is read-only, I don't think your view can be defined in an updatable manner (I could be wrong) Requires change to the database, you may need to create lots of views  Alternately, if your DBA won't even let you add a view to the database, or if you need to perform updates:  2. Use Hibernate's dynamic model mapping facility to map your C1, C2, C3 properties to a Map, and have some code you your DAO layer do the appropriate conversation between the Map and the Collection property: I have never done this myself, but I believe Hibernate does allow you to map tables to HashMaps. I'm not sure how dynamically Hibernate allows you to do this (i.e., Can you get away with simply specifying the table name, and having Hibernate automatically map all the columns?), but it's another way I can think of doing this. If going with this approach though, be sure to use the data access object pattern, and ensure that the internal implementation (use of HashMaps) is hidden from the client code. Also be sure to check before writing to the database that the size of your collection does not exceed the number of available columns. The benefits of this approach:  No change to the database at all Data is updatable O/R Mapping is relatively simple  The drawbacks:  Lots of plumbing in the DAO layer to map the appropriate types Uses experimental Hibernate features that may change in the future ",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1
