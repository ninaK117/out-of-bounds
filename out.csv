2,Programmatic method to let the user modify the manifest.json content of a Chrome extension,"<p>I am developing a Chrome extension for use with the Canvas LMS. A problem with this is that Canvas subscribers have different URLs which do not have a common top level domain. For instance, my University's Canvas site has the URL  while another school might have .

Instead, I have to enter , and then programmatically (in the  code) weed out sites that don't have ""canvas"" in them. </p>
<p>That works in its own kludgy way, but Chrome Web Store is not very happy about it, which delays my updates by days.</p>
<p>One could of course use a narrow/dummy  value and then ask the users to edit the manifest themselves to include the specific URL in used in each respective case, but how likely would they be to do that?

<pre></pre>
<p>So basically, if they have an equal reference, return . If either of them are  or their counts are different, return . Then return if the sequences (ordered by their keys and then their values) are the same. I <strong>must</strong> be missing something, as it's far too short to be good enough.</p>","<p>Yes, your code will work, so long as the keys all implement  and both the keys and values have an  method that compares what you want it to compare.  If either the keys or the values don't have appropriate implementations of those methods then this won't work.</p>
<p>Your method also doesn't provide functionality for custom  or  objects to be passed in to account for the cases where the object doesn't have a desirable implementation of one of those methods.  Whether this is an issue in your particular case we can't say.</p>
<p>Your solution also needs to sort all of the values, which is somewhat less efficient than other possible implementations of a set equals, but it's not <em>dramatically</em> worse, so if you don't have particularly large collections that shouldn't be a huge issue.</p>
<p>A method with comparable functionality to yours but improved speed would be (keeping the first two checks you have):</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Since this method doesn't rely on sorting it also provides the benefit of not needing  to implement .</p>
<p>A key reason that both this method and your method works is due to the fact that  overrides it's definition of  and  to to be based on it's own reference, but rather on the key and value it wraps.  Two  are equal if both the keys and values are equal, and the hash code incorporates the hash code of both the key and the value.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.07295173961840629,0.4,0.6666666666666666,1,1

<p>Whenever the worker thread runs out of work he s on a  which is protected by the same  as the stack holding the data for the worker thread (you might want to use a queue here instead to minimize the risk of unfair work scheduling).</p>
<p>Your  function now calls  on that condition variable whenever it inserts new data into the stack. That way, the worker thread will truly sleep (i.e. the OS scheduler will probably not give it any timeslice) until there is actually work to be done.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to get wrong here is the locking of the mutex protecting both the stack and the condition_variable. Besides avoiding races on the data structures, you also need to take care that the condition_variable does not miss a notify call and therefore might get stuck waiting while there actually is more work available.</p>

123,"TFS says I am not a member of the Team Foundation Valid Users group, but I am","<p>I'm trying to check in changes to TFS using VS2013.  When I hit the button to submit, TFS returns the following error, ""TF14002: The identity {domain} \ {oldaccount} is not a member of the Team Foundation Valid Users group.""</p>
<p>Background:  my account name has been changed to {newaccount} from {oldaccount}.</p>
<p>When I first started working at this company I'm almost certain I set up my TFS with my old account.  But I thought I deleted all that stuff related to my old account and reset everything to my new account.  My lead tech has even shown me the account mngmnt screen with my new account name.  And I've been able to check out items with my new account name.</p>
<p>I performed the following steps to try to ""clean out"" TFS:
<br/>•  I copied all of my changed files to a back-up location.
<br/>•  I undid all changes in TFS (note that TFS has been allowing me to check out files to edit).
<br/>•  I deleted the TFS entry in Credential Manager per a suggestion online.
<br/>•  I deleted my Workspace.
<br/>•  I even deleted my TFS server.
<br/>•  I Rebooted my computer.
<br/>•  I reconnected to the TFS server.
<br/>•  I rebuilt my Workspace.
<br/>•  I restored my changed files from my back-up location.</p>
<p>At this point I tried checking-in my changes again but got the same error message as above.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Note that I do NOT have access to the TFS server, much less permissions to perform any sort of admin on it (and I don't know the person who would).  So any suggestions beyond simply tweaking my computer will require a trip through the bureaucratic swamp.</p>
<p>One possible positive (related to this issue) is that we've been informed that a number of us need to downgrade from ""Ultimate"" to ""Professional"" so if your suggestion is to reinstall Visual Studio, the upside is that I'll be doing that soon anyway.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1/24/2015:<br/>
I did finally ""downgrade"" from Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate to VS2013 Professional, but I'm still experiencing the same error.  Might there be a table in the TFS database that still has an entry for my old account that could be joining to my computer name &amp;/or new account name when TFS goes to look up my account info when I check in my changes?  I am getting desperate for an answer!</p>
<p>An addendum:  when the sys-admins changed my account name they did not update my computer itself, so I'm still using C:\Users\{oldaccount}.  I can't believe that would make a difference but you never know....</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2/27/2016:</strong><br/>
Sorry for not updating this sooner.  I resolved this issue with the help of our DBAs:</p>
<p>There is a table named <strong>Constants</strong> which contains the domain part and a field named “NamePart”.  The resolution was to simply update “NamePart” to “{newaccount}” from “{oldaccount}”.  This table also has an SID field which is the user’s SID from the computer’s Registry.  You'd only change the SID if a new login to your computer was created.  In my case, there was no new login account, just a change to my login account -name-, therefore, no new SID.</p>
<p>And a side note, for situations when one’s email is also spelled incorrectly, there is also the <strong>ADObjects</strong> table which contains a field named “MailNickName”.  This field should be updated as well when a user name is misspelled.  For instance, I had the DBA update that field to change “Dug@NotReal.net” to “Doug@NotReal.net”.</p>

<p>is there a better way to solve this problem?</p>
<p>i'm thinking of adding an ID to each busy intent, so they can be paired. that way if i receive a start for which i've already received a stop, i can ignore it. or, perhaps more simply, add an integer sequence number into each broadcast. if i ever receive a broadcast for which the sequence of the current intent is less than the sequence of the last received intent, ignore it.</p>","<p>Answering my own question ...</p>
<p>At least one viable alternative to intents is to execute messaging through the application class, i.e.,</p>
<ol>
<li>create a listener interface</li>
<li>Manager a collection of listener objects in the application / provide methods to add / remove listener</li>
<li>Interested entities call the application methods to add / remove themselves as listeners</li>
<li>Add ""notify"" methods in the application, that call the appropriate listener interface method on each of the registered listeners</li>
<li>Services call the application's notification methods to</li>

You could just use Node for the chat server and PHP for everything else.</p>
<p>The reason you are seeing POST errors is probably due to the constant polling that you are doing.  Browsers generally have a limit on the number of concurrent connections to a given server.  Traditionally, a domain was limited to 2 concurrent connections, although that is changed now in some browsers (I'm thinking Chrome).  I suspect your are seeing errors when the POSTs start to ""run over"" each other and exceed the limit.  Besides, polling like this will quickly kill a server in a mult-user system.</p>
<p>Instead of constantly polling, you want something that handles push messaging, like web sockets and long-polling fall-back. The Socket.IO and Strophie libraries provide this.  I have experience with Strophie/XMPP - and I can confirm that it is a LOT more complicated. Socket.IO scales easily to thousands (or tens of thousands) per server.

<p>1.The bounce rate is increased when a user visits your page and leaves without interacting with your site / visiting another page.</p>
<p>2.Refreshing the page does not start a new session/pageview. No matter how many times they visit your site they will re-open the exact same session for 30mins.</p>
<p>3.Javascript refresh or meta refresh does not count as user interaction. You may also want to read more about Google and Javascripts. Google can read your content even if you use javascript or refresh for Dynamic content.

It might also be considered a problematic user experience and lower your techincal seo scores (page load times etc.). As you can see you might only get problems by using such methods. I would suggest you to not proceed with the idea.</p>",0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.14186307519640853,0.4,0.5,0,0

I then match it with my database, to see if the user already exists, and if not, i create one. I also assign a role for the user in my custom Role provider, but i had the infinite loop problem before this. Then i set</p>

<p>This is the code I currently have:</p>

After that I included the whole socket setup (the code above) in the loop, but that also didn't help. I also tried closing the socket after a failed connection, but this didn't help either.  </p>

<p>Can I force connect() to return after a certain amount of time has passed? Or is there a way to get the connect() function to try multiple times on it's own?

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>","<blockquote>
<p>Can I force  to return after a certain amount of time has passed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. You must put the socket into non-blocking mode and then use  or  to provide timeout logic while you wait for the socket to connect. If the connection fails, or takes too long to connect, close the socket, create a new one, and try again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is there a way to get the  function to try multiple times on it's own?</p>

<p>No. It can perform only 1 connection attempt per call.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is no guarantee that you can even call  multiple times on the same socket. On some platforms, you must destroy the socket and create a new socket before you call  again.

Create a singleton ""FooManager"" class to hold data required in different parts of your app, and access the data through the API of the singleton class.  I think this is much cleaner than hanging everything off of ProjectAppDelegate.    This should also solve your write/read race condition.</p>

<p>Just to give an update - I installed PostgreSQL locally to make sure that it wasn't something to do with that. It wasn't. Even in production, it all works when hosted locally. As I say, I think the problem occurs in the fact that it isn't even getting to the database part.</p>

I could put in an .html.erb view, but I don't want one (I just want it to return to the user index page)...though if I can't come up with any other solution, I may try it, just to see if it works.</p>

262,Empty file when saving as PNG,"<p>I’ve got a method which takes an input image, does some things to the image, then saves it to another file. At its most basic it resizes the image, but it can do a few more complicated things like converting to greyscale, quantizing etc, but for the case of this question I’m only attempting to resize the image and not performing any of the other actions.</p>
<p>It looks something like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-csharp prettyprint-override""></pre>
<p>Then to use it I’d call something like: </p>
<p>That should open up the “image.png” file, resize in to 300×300, then save it to “output.png” as a PNG file. But it’s not working—the file that gets created is in the correct location but has a file size of zero and contains no image at all.</p>
<p>This also only seems to happen when I pass in the parameter ; if I pass , then it works fine and creates the image file perfectly.</p>
<p>I’m wondering if there’s some sort of delay occurring between creating the image and somewhere else in the code attempting to access the image that’s been created (not in the above code) which locks up the file and so it’s never written to? Could that be the case?</p>
<p>Any ideas what else could be going on?</p>

<p>Is there a parameter that can configure continuous mode? If a CmdLet takes single objects, it can be called as data comes into the pipeline, but if a CmdLet takes an array, perhaps PS accumulates and sends the whole array in. Sorting needs a complete set, for example.</p>
<p>I'm interested in writing long-running, open-ended, streaming style CmdLets.</p>
<p>Thanks. I can't find any in-depth discussion on the pipeline.</p>","<p><strong>First Part:</strong> No, PowerShell functions do not necessarily get passed into a cmdlet immediately but instead go into a special variable called $input.</p>
<p>$input is populated with all the incoming pipeline objects before a function begins to execute. If necessary, PowerShell may even delay execution until all incoming pipeline data is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Second Part:</strong> If you'd like to continuously process your data instead of waiting for it to come in and be stored in $input, you can use the <strong>filter</strong> keyword in place of the <strong>function</strong> key word when writing your functions/filters (filters behave similarly to functions except they don't wait for data, but use it as it becomes available).</p>

The problem is that the last summand is 2<sup>64</sup>, so the usual calculation takes a long time.

<p>Please, can anyone help me with this problem?</p>","<p>There's a <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PowerSum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">formula to calculate the sum of the powers of 4 of all integers from 1 to n</a>:</p>
<p>sum(k<sup>4</sup>) <sub>for 1&lt;=k&lt;=n</sub> = (6*n<sup>5</sup> + 15*n<sup>4</sup> + 10*n<sup>3</sup> - n) / 30</p>
<p>In your problem you need to sum up only powers of 4 of k's that have an even number of ones in their binary representation. And this formula doesn't exclude k's with odd number of ones.</p>
<p>However, my gut feeling tells me that the sum of powers of 4 of k's that have an odd number of ones should be about the same as the sum of powers of 4 of k's with an even number of ones.</p>

My goal is to have what people type into the editor look exactly like the page it publishes.  I've almost got it, except Tinymce adds a  if a user puts two spaces in between their sentences.  Obviously, in the editor, it collapses that  if it's at the beginning of a line so that every line is all the way against the left side of the editor.  In the finished page though, this creates situations where there's a space at the beginning of a line in a 'p' tag.  I could just strip out the , but then it would look differently in the editor than the final page.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way to collapse a  at the beginning of lines in a  tag?  Or is there a way to format this differently in TinyMCE so that the editor and the final page would look the exact same?  Thanks!</p>","<p>As Diodeus stated already you cannot collapse a single character and you will have to strip it out if you want to get rid of it.
Many browsers will 'compress' more than one entered space in a row to one single space. This means there will be one visible space only even if the user entered 15 spaces. That's the reason why tinymce enters a protected space. Now, all spaces entered will be shown for the price of a different kind of space.</p>

<p>Just modifying it to this will get it to work with the first object in the array.  You would need to iterate through each object though to get it to work for all of them.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Because you are using a nested object, this becomes a slightly more complicated problem to solve.  You have an array of objects that also have arrays in them.  If you (can) put everything into a flatter object, it's simple.</p>
<p>The  tells it to access the first object in the csTagGrp array, which is:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So now  accesses the csTags array in the object at [0] in the csTagGrp array and performs the sort on all the  in that array.  So far so good.  But with the object structure you have here, you  need to iterate through both arrays (that is, all the objects in csTagGrp, as well as each csTags array in each csTagGrp object) and perform a sort on ALL of them.  This usually involves multiple for loops.  </p>
<p>So to accomplish this, I concat'ed all the csTags arrays (using a for loop) into a new array, , which then gets passed to sort.  This gives us what we need (one flat array) to check all the csTags arrays for duplicates.</p>

<p>So I now understand I need to call the method  (which translates as RequestForInformation) with a message of type . </p>
<p>But from here I'm kinda lost. How do I construct such a ? How can I further introspect into this ?</p>
<p>Any tips on how to proceed from here would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>ps. If I should use another library (but I prefer Python) that is also okay. I read good things about <a href=""https://fedorahosted.org/suds/"" rel=""nofollow"">suds</a>, but since that didn't have a commit <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/mirror/suds/commits/all"" rel=""nofollow"">for over 3 years</a> I considered it abandonware. I also tried pysimplesoap, which seems good, but I didn't know how to use it to introspect into the SOAP service.</p>","<p>Your observations to this point are right. But I'd first explore the WSDL with a SOAP client tool to get a grasp on its structure and references. When you look at the WSDL, notice how the types are defined in a referenced  schema named . Then this schema is referencing and including 20 other schema files:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/M5HnyPs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">High-res image - click here.</a></p>
<p><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WjLK.jpg""/></p>
<p>Obviously in your case it becomes a nightmare to follow everything by just reading yourself (WSDL is not indended for human reading by design anyway, but yours is very, very nested). </p>
<p>So I suggest you import this WSDL in <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/soapui/files/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SOAP UI</a> (it is free, this is what I used in the screenshot above) and create a new project using the WSDL url:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www1.kadaster.nl/1/schemas/kik-inzage/20141101/verzoekTotInformatie-2.1.wsdl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www1.kadaster.nl/1/schemas/kik-inzage/20141101/verzoekTotInformatie-2.1.wsdl</a></p>
<p>It will import eveything and create a sample request for you. For me it even tried to add some lorem-ipsum sample data, based on the types of the fields:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>After everything is imported you can expand the project and then right-click on the binding  and select  to explore any types (including the request) you need to further introspect that are defined in the referenced schemas.</p>
<p>With the whole definition at your disposal it will be much easier to do an introspection. In your case, there must be an option to import the WSDL and ""expand"" all the includes/references first and only then begin introspecting, when you have the whole picture available. If there is no such option, you might have to follow the references and includes one by one.</p>

<p>Basically, my script is to store other scripts in the headers of the Maya scene file, so you may call a command and it'll execute the matching script. It stores the scripts in text format in a dictionary, where I've done a wrapper like thing so you can input args and kwargs without much trouble, and because you can only enter and execute the scripts personally, there's virtually no danger of anything being malicious unless you do it to yourself.</p>
<p>The list is pickled and base64 encoded as it all needs to be in string format for the header, so each time the function is called it decodes the dictionary so you can edit or read it, so ideally I'd need the functions built each time it is called.</p>

<p>Let's say Role A has value .
This means that a user with Role A should access every webpage that sits in the directory .

358,Maximum array sum,"<p>I am given an array of integers. I need to find max sum of its elements so that any two elements are not neighbors.

How can it be done using any programming language? 
I have been working on this problem for several hours and the only thing I understand that it should use DP.</p>","<p>So I've implemented a solution in Java without using DP; I've simply used recursion. I'll try to explain it a bit. </p>
<p>First of all, we have to find a base case: </p>
<ul>
<li>if the array length is == 1, then sum(array) = array[0]</li>
<li>besides, if the array length is == 2, then sum(array) = max(array[0],array[1])</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's get to the general case of array.length = n. We have to decide whether or not array[n-1] is part of the solution; that is, if sum, launched on the first n-1 elements, is smaller than sum launched on the first n-2 elements + nth element of the array. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, we are saying ""Is it better to consider the nth element or its neighbour (nth-1)?"" Indeed, we cannot consider both, therefore we have to choose one.</p>

<ol>

<li>then iterate through each index and check the length of word add it to an ArrayList of strings containing that length where these ArrayList are mapped in a hashmap with length of words it is containing.</li>
</ol>","<p>Firstly, your code is working only for the files which contain one word by line as you're processing whole lines as words. To make your code more universal you have to process each line by splitting it to words:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Secondly, you don't need any temporary data structures. You can add your words to the map right after you read the line from file.  and  lists are actually useless here as they do not contain any logic except temporary storing. You're using  list just to store the lengths which has already been added to the  map. The same can be reached by invoking .</p>

<p>I am writing a framework and I do not want to force a specific IoC container on users.</p>

<p>The way to do that is to create good extension points for users to replace. Having a common DI abstraction is a bad idea, because this is an anti-pattern called <a href=""http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/conforming-container/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Conforming Container</a>. This anti-pattern is not something theoretical; ASP.NET Core applies this anti-pattern and the result of this is that both the Simple Injector maintainers AND the Autofac Maintainers were unable to create an adapter implementation that fully complies with the defined contract. The Simple Injector story can be read <a href=""https://simpleinjector.org/blog/2016/06/whats-wrong-with-the-asp-net-core-di-abstraction/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://simpleinjector.org/blog/2016/07/working-around-the-asp-net-core-di-abstraction/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and a general discussion with Microsoft about this can be found <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection/pull/416"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. You can read my open letter to Microsoft in this thread <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection/pull/416#issuecomment-231736332"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and you can see that the Autofac maintainers <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection/pull/416#issuecomment-231773011"" rel=""noreferrer"">agree</a> with this statement.</p>

Whilst in recording mode, every option adjusted is added to the must-do list of actions.

We don't use angular's , this will mix . Rather we initialize FieldB as disabled

If i increase the throughput to 1600 RU/s, does this query execute in half a second? I am not seeing any significant changes in query performance by playing around with the RUs.</p>","<p>As I explained in a different, but somewhat related answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/56418458/272109"">here</a>, Request Units are allocated on a per-second basis. In the event a given query will cost more than the number of Request Units available in that one-second window:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query will be executed</li>
<li>You will now be in ""debt"" by the overage in Request Units</li>
<li>You will be throttled until your ""debt"" is paid off</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say you had 400 RU/sec, and you executed a query that cost 800 RU. It would complete, but then you'd be in debt for around 2 seconds (400 RU per second, times two seconds). At this point, you wouldn't be throttled anymore.</p>
<p>The speed in which a query executes does not depend on the number of RU allocated. Whether you had 1,000 RU/second OR 100,000 RU/second, a query would run in the same amount of time (aside from any throttle time preventing the query from running initially). So, aside from throttling, your 800 RU query would run consistently, regardless of RU count.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.07901234567901234,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0,0

453,Animation stops working after swapping,"<p>I have a class which extends a SWC , in the swc i have two boxes, front and back and an animation on the same timeline. The animation works fine without swapping when I swap them the animation stops working. Anyway I can make it work?</p>
<p>I have the following code :</p>
<pre></pre>","<p>The short answer is, you should avoid using both frame animations and scripts on the same objects. Basically, frame animations and scripts are two different ways to control the properties of clips (position, size, stacking order, etc). And if you use them both, Flash has no unambiguous way to know which set of instructions should take precedence. The way Flash deals with this problem is, once you use scripts to update something, it is no longer affected by frame animations from then on (unless it gets removed from the stage and re-added).</p>

467,Metric to measure object-orientedness,"<p>Is there a metric that can assist in determining the object-orientedness of a system or application? I've seen some pretty neat metrics in the .NET Reflector Add-ins codeplex project, but nothing like this yet. If such a metric doesn't exist, would it even be possible or useful? There are the 3 supposed tenets of object-oriented programming: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism; a tool that ranked programs against these might be able to show areas of a C# (or similar) code base where the whole object-oriented ideal was discarded, and perhaps how many bugs are associated with that area versus the rest of the project.</p>","<p>One meaningful interpretation of a good OO design is that objects in a design map logically and consistently to the domain objects being modeled.  Interpreting this requires a deep knowledge of the problem you're trying to solve, including the overall context.  Automated metrics are not yet sophisticated enough to understand context in this way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In response to the comment, I thought I would expand a bit:</p>
<p>The main point I was hoping to make is that OO is not 'encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism'.  Those are just tools that enable modeling of a problem as objects that interact in well-defined ways.  If you want a good metric, you need to understand what you're really trying to measure.  It sounds like you're trying to validate a 'gut feel' notion of code quality with a metric to back up the feeling.  If that's the case, what's the real underlying concern?  Are you worried the code is brittle and likely to break easily due to unexpected side effects?  Is the object model too fragmented and hard to follow?  Are the individual objects too large to understand and maintain?  If you can define better the kinds of flaws you're hoping to to identify, it will help you to find appropriate metrics.  In case they are helpful, here is one <a href=""http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/07/15/129265.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">useful set of metrics</a>.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.01705948372615039,0.2,0.8333333333333333,0,0

<p>vs</p>
<pre></pre>","<p>From the technical point of view, there aren't any big differences between the two, so it is a question of coding style and personal preferences. Here are a couple of points that you can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The declarative approach using the ASP.NET markup is usually shorter and you don't need a large method that does all the initialization</li>
<li>If you initialize handlers in the code-behind you don't pollute the declarative markup with aspects relevant only for the code-behind (though I don't think this is a big issue)</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases you can use features such as C# lambda expressions nicely in the code-behind:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Something like this can reduce the number of single-purpose event handling methods that you need to write, which should make the code-behind simpler.</p>

<p>Note: by default, winrm over http and the listener should be set up and listening on your machines. winrm uses message level encryption, so it's not completely in plaintext. You can verify with:</p>

525,Can I prerender Angular and fall back to SSR from S3?,"<p>I have an Angular app that is currently server-side rendered by .Net Core. I want to change my build process to prerender almost all of my site and push all the static files to an Amazon S3 bucket and point my domain name there instead. However, I cannot prerender all of my website (at least not yet).</p>
<p>I found how I can <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/49801027/64279"">return my index.html</a> for any pages which are not prerendered and don't exist in the S3 bucket, which will allow me to client-side render the page, but I want to take it a step further and server-side render the page on-the-fly.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can use the S3 site as a reverse proxy that will fetch the SSR page from my .Net Core site if the prerendered version does not exist?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just to be clear, the S3 bucket will be for a CloudFront CDN, so setting up a proxy in front of the S3 bucket probably isn't an option.</p>

<p>But, if your static content can easily be identified by path, you could create <strong>two origins</strong> in CloudFront, one for static and one for dynamic content, and serve them using different <strong>behavior/path pattern</strong> combination for each origin: S3 bucket for your static content and maybe a custom origin for your dynamic content (hosted on EC2).</p>

535,SignalR client misses some events at a regular interval,"<p>I have a straightforward SignalR setup: OWIN-hosted .NET server and JavaScript client (both @ v2.1.1). The client uses SignalR to synchronize its copy of an ordered event stream maintained in an Rx  on the server. When a client connects, it provides a  query parameter that is used to initialize an  against the , and this observer then sends each event in the observed sequence to the client. Each event has a sequence number, and the client can tell, based on the event sequence number, if any event is missing in the sequence. (Which would be a serious problem in this application.)</p>
<p>The problem is that the client regularly receives only portions of the event sequence. In fact, there is a regular pattern to this. <strong>For every 250 events there is a large gap.</strong> So for example, each test shows that the first gap was from somewhere between 70 and 80 to 250. <em>Why always 250?</em> And from there on, the ""skip-to"" point is always in intervals of <strong>250</strong>; e.g., a gap from 263 to <em>500</em>, then one from 511 to <em>750</em>, etc.. I have to assume that this is some kind of default buffer size.</p>
<p>Also, the first time a client connects to the server it always receives the entire sequence just fine. It's the subsequent connections that exhibit the regular skipping problem. So it seems like it's a server-side problem, and not a client problem at all.</p>
<p>I then added some checks to the server to ensure that the  for each client is seeing all of the events in the correct order. It is. So it seems almost certain that the problem is on the SignalR server side and has nothing to do with Rx.</p>
<p>And finally, I checked to see if the dropped messages were perhaps just being delivered out of order (which I could live with, although I assumed SignalR provides an ordered-delivery guarantee). They are not - the messages just disappear into a void.</p>
<p>If it helps, I'm currently running locally, with IIS Express on Win 8.1 x64 and testing on IE Developer Channel as well as Chrome 36. The connection is using WebSockets. I couldn't find any reference to 250 as a special quantity in either the SignalR source (client or server) or the Rx.Net source.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on troubleshooting? I'd love to find a stable solution before I start building a complicated workaround.</p>
<p>Here's the relevant server-side code:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""></pre>","<p>The issue you are experiencing seems consistent with a message buffer overflow. When SignalR releases messages from its buffer, it does so in 250 message fragments by default.</p>
<p>SignalR will buffer at least the last 1000 messages sent to a given . This means that when you send the 1251st message, the first 250 get dereferenced by the buffer. This explains why when a client <em>first</em> connects to the server, it receives the entire sequence of messages. You have to send at least 1251 messages to a given client before the buffer will drop fragments. Again, this is all assuming default settings.</p>
<p>While you could increase the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.aspnet.signalr.configuration.defaultconfigurationmanager.defaultmessagebuffersize(v=vs.118).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">DefaultMessageBufferSize</a>, that probably will not fix your root problem. It seems that you are trying to send messages faster than the server can send them to the client. If you do that continuously, you will run out of buffer space no matter the size.</p>
<p>It's more common to <a href=""http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/signalr-20/performance-and-scaling/signalr-performance#tuning"" rel=""nofollow"">reduce the DefaultMessageBufferSize</a> rather than increase it, since the buffers can consume a lot of memory, especially if you are sending a lot of large unique messages to many different clients.</p>
<p>Your best bet to avoid overrunning the buffer is to have the client send an ACK at least every 1000 messages. Given this, it might be possible to avoid sending over 1000 unACKed messages thereby avoiding this problem altogether.</p>
<p>By the way, you can take a look at <a href=""https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR/blob/2.1.1/src/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Core/Messaging/MessageStore.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">SignalR's message buffer implementation</a> yourself if you feel so inclined.

539,Custom Flex/ActionScript UIComponent Keeps Getting Painted Multiple Times During a Resize,"<p>I've created a custom uicomponent and whenever the browser or its specific container is resized, a repaint occurs but the contents of the component get drawn again and again and again...
So, if I move the container I'll end up with multiple circles drawn on top of each other but offset depending upon where the container is when the repaint occurs.

Do I need to do some sort of clear so that it doesn't contiuously getting duplicated like this???

541,when to prefer pessimistic model of transaction isolation over optimistic one?,"<p>Do I understand correctly that table/row lock hints are being used for pessimistic transaction (TX) isolation models of concurrency <strong>ONLY</strong>?<br/>
In other words, when can table/row lock hints be used during engagement of optimistic TX isolation provided by SQL Server (2005 and higher)?     </p>
<p>When one would need pessimistic TX isolation levels/hints in SQL Server2005+ if the later provides built-in optimistic (aka snapshot aka versioning) concurrency isolation?<br/>
I did read that pessimistic options are legacy and are not needed anymore, though I am in doubt.  </p>
<p>Also, having optimistic (aka snapshot aka versioning) TX isolation levels  built-in SQL Server2005+, 
when one would need to manually code for optimistic concurrency  features?  </p>
<p>The last question is inspired by having read:  </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>describing custom coding to provide versioning in SQL Server.  </p>","<p>Optimistic concurrency requires more resources and is more expensive when the conflict occurs.</p>
<p>Two sessions can read and modify the values and the conflict only occurs when they try to apply their changes simultaneously. This means that in case of the concurrent update both values should be stored somewhere (which of course requires resources).</p>
<p>Also, when a conflict occurs, usually the whole transaction should be rolled back or the cursor refetched, which is expensive too.</p>
<p>Pessimistic concurrency model uses locking, thus downgrading concurrency but improving performance.</p>
<p>In case of two concurrent tasks, it may be cheaper for the second task to wait for a lock to release than spending  time and disk  on two simultaneous works and then yet more on rolling back the less fortunate work and redoing it.</p>
<p>Say, you have a query like this:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>, with  reading some data from  itself. In other words, this query transforms a subset of  sharing the value of .</p>
<p>Now, when two functions work on the same range, there may be two scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pessimistic: the first query locks, the second query waits for it. The first query completes in  seconds, the second one does too. Total:  seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimistic: both queries work independently (on the same input). This shares  time between them plus some overhead on switching. They should keep their intermediate data somewhere, so the data is stored twice (which implies twice  or memory). Let's say both complete almost at the same time, in seconds.</p>
<p>But when it's time to commit the work, the second query will conflict and will have to rollback its changes (say, it takes the same  seconds). Then it needs to reread the data again and do the work again, with the new set of data ( seconds).</p>
<p>As a result, <em>both</em> queries complete later than with a pessimistic locking:  and  seconds vs.  and .</p></li>

594,How to transform data from S3 bucket before writing to Redshift DW?,"<p>I'm creating a (modern) data warehouse in redshift. All of our infrastructure is hosted at Amazon. So far, I have setup DMS to ingest data (including changed data) from some tables of our business database (SQL Server on EC2, not RDS) and store it directly to S3.</p>
<p>Now I must transform and enrich this data from the S3 before I can write it to Redshift. Our DW have some tables for facts and dimensions (star schema), so, imagine a Customer dimension, it should contain not only the customer basic info, but address info, city, state, etc. This data is spread amongst a few tables in our business database.</p>
<p>So here's my problem, I don't have a clear idea of how to query the S3 staging area in order to join these tables and write it to my redshift DW. I want to do it using AWS services like Glue, Kinesis, etc. i.e. full serverless.</p>
<p>Can Kinesis accomplish this task? Would it make things easier if I moved my staging area from S3 to Redshift since all of our data is highly relational in nature anyway? If so, the question remains, how to transform/enrich data before saving it on our DW schemas? I have searched everywhere for this particular topic but information on it is scarse.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>","<p>There are a lot of ways to do this but one idea is to query the data using Redshift Spectrum. Spectrum is a way to query S3 (called an external database) using your Redshift cluster.</p>
<p>Really high-level, one way to do this would be to create a Glue Crawler job to crawl your S3 bucket, which creates the External Database that Redshift Spectrum can query.</p>
<p>This way, you don't need to move your data into Redshift itself. Likely, you will want to keep your ""staging"" area in S3 and only bring into Redshift the data that is ready to be used for reporting or analytics, which would be your Customer Dim table.</p>
<p>Here is the documentation to do this: <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-getting-started-using-spectrum.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-getting-started-using-spectrum.html</a></p>
<p>To schedule the ETL SQL: I don't believe there is a scheduling tool built into Redshift but you can do that in a few ways:</p>
<p>1) Get an ETL tool or set up CRON jobs on a server or Glue that schedules SQL scripts to be ran. I do this with a Python script that connects to the database then runs the SQL text. This would be a little bit more of a bulk operation. You can also do this in a Lambda function and have it be scheduled on a Cloudwatch trigger which can be on a cron schedule </p>
<p>2) Use a Lambda function that runs the SQL script that you want that triggers for S3 PUTs into that bucket. That way the script will run right when the file drops. This would be basically a realtime operation. DMS drops files very quickly so you will have files dropping multiple times per minute so that might be more difficult to handle. </p>",0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.1719416386083053,0.4,0.16666666666666666,0,0

<p>I didn't see anything about this when I read over the documentation at <a href=""http://tower-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_ref/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://tower-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_ref/index.html</a>.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can make the content colors less prominent? </p>

<p>As you might know, filtering an impulse input would give you the impulse response. It then remains to obtain those  and  coefficients.

It is more typical to plot the frequency response, which corresponds to the  evaluated on the unit-circle (i.e. for complex number satisfying  or equivalently  with theta in the [0-2pi] range). An efficient method to compute values of  at regularly spaced points on that unit-circle is to take the FFT of the impulse response:</p>

617,Angular-strap $affix service instantiation issue,"<p>I'm trying to use Angular-strap's $affix service to programmatically attach affix behavior to 3 different elements; two of these must respond to whether the target browser is roughly desktop-width or greater (in which case they MUST NOT affix), and the third must always affix.  A complicating factor is whether or not the receiving device is either a desktop browser or a mobile device (&amp; further whether said mobile device is either in landscape or portrait mode), because there are stylistic adjustments required for various device breakpoints, and this drives changes to the affix offsets for these three elements.</p>
<p>To this end I've managed to put together some logic for handling these different cases, and to keep sane I've located the logic for my use of $affix within its own directive attached to my Angular app.  I've also isolated logic for detecting orientationchange events in its own directive, and within my affix directive I've got a callback setup to trip on orient::change, which calls my handleFixes() function, which in turn calls my helper functions (to recalculate the proper offsets) and then calls $affix() on each affixed element to update its behavior.</p>
<p>In theory this should work fine.  In practice it looks like the $affix service is unable to attach callbacks to ""scroll"", ""click"" or ""resize"" events, because it's expecting targetEl to be an element but instead it's undefined.  As a result, $affix isn't working at all.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> what's happening is my directive definition isn't properly communicating the intended target element (the BODY tag) into $affix, but that may not be the end of it.</p>
<p>Here's my directive definition <strong>EDITED</strong>:</p>

Initially I figured out that the reason I didn't seem to have a target element was that I wasn't explicitly passing a ""target"" option into $affix().  On the assumption that it was an appropriate target I tried using $('body').</p>
<p>When it became apparent that this still wasn't having the intended effect -- that is, nothing I wanted to affix to the page was actually affixing to the page, despite the absence of any errors in the console log -- I decided to figure out how bs-affix works, found its definition in the source code and voila!  Clear as day, it attempts to resolve a provided target element, but lacking that it resolves to ""angular.element($window)"".  Obviously I didn't have $window readily available in my directive, so after adding it alongside the $affix service in my injected parameters, I used it instead of ""$('body')"" and things are now working as intended.</p>

635,Jscrollpane moving content around,"<p>I'm a new poster but have used Staockoverflow many a time for help in a tricky situation but this time after much searching and hair pulling I think I need to post. </p>
<p>I'm using Jscrollpane to style a scroll bar on a very basic site. For ages there was a default scrollbar visible at the side of my div but when I added the jscrollpane code it disappeared. I spent ages working through my code and it turns out that the issue is that the content in my div is too long. It's fine for the default scrollbar but with Jscrollpane it just doesn't work. As a result I've taken out some content and it works BUT there's a new problem - if I only have a little content in there all is well but if I have a fair amount of content then the end content is pushed to the top of the div whilst the beginning content and the scrollbar itself actually start near the bottom of the div! I'm not quite sure how to fix this and would be grateful for any help. Also if you know how I can use Jscrollpane with whatever length content I want that would be the best option as I really need a lot of content in this one div!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>below are some images to help explain</p>
<p>Also my code is currently the default jScrollPane.js code downloaded directly from the jscrollpane site and i'm just calling it using:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>where #ts_and_cs is my terms and conditions div where I want the scrollbar to be used. As I say the code works fine so long as the content is short so I just need a way to enable it to allow much much longer content. thanks  </p>

I have created the xib, added the elements and created outlets for the button/textbox and the TableView.</p>

<p>Actually to test, I immediatly start using to models in my list. 
The model looks as following: </p>

<p>And the Cell-Implementation:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So and now the problem:
The title is not shown in the list-item. Actually the binding seems to work as the list displays tow items. My binding works on the TextBox and the Button as well. So this is not the problem. Following the debug.Output:</p>

When you only want to show a very simple UITableView, then use ""MvxStandardTableViewSource""-class instead of writing an own TableViewSource/cells.

674,Replacing a varying string after search criteria using SED,"<p>Inside a shell script amidst error checking loops, I have a command that contains a variable that must be updated once an hour.  The command as it exists currently is (the line begins with a \t):</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In this case, I'm trying to replace the number that's after ""-O"".  This is a temperature in Fahrenheit, so it has the possibility of being a negative number or a positive number, and one, two, or three digits followed by a single decimal place.  So I have to be able to replace a variable that could be ""-15.0"", ""7.2"", ""104.5"", or any other combination - with a new variable that could also be any of the above.</p>
<p>I can force the ""-O"" setting to be the last thing on the line, which helps some.  But I can't count on anything else on that line except the file name, the ""-d /dev/ttyUSB0"" and the ""-O"" always being there.  In this particular shell script there are no other instances of ""-O"", but I might want to verify that the line has either the file name or the ""-d /dev/ttyUSB0"" on it to avoid replacing a flag on some other line in the script.</p>
<p>The new variable is parsed (via xmllint and sed) from an XML file grabbed via wget once an hour.  This shell script I need to edit is ran by cron every 5 minutes, only receiving the new string once an hour.  The new string can be passed to sed via a variable, or as a file with only the number and a \n in it.</p>

</ol>
<p>So how do I make it so the CheckBoxes will stay checked when the leave and return to the screen? And will this method fill Android's memory with Views if the the list is sufficiently long?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:
I liked @user3815165's answer because I didn't need to store the  value for a  which doesn't have a checkbox. But as I mentioned in a comment, since the  list is not in the context of the Activity then the values of whether each  is checked or not persists when the view is destroyed and creates bugs.</p>
<p>So I decided to go with @Palash's answer, even though it stored data not needed (only a single  value for each  in the list). It works perfectly.</p>","<p>you need to maintain a status array of type boolean in your activity, pass that array into your list adapter and while setting the checkbox check status of that position, also you need to update that status array likewise on click event of checkbox.

679,How do I stop focus from changing when I reset EditTexts?,"<p>My fragment has a Reset button that clears some EditTexts and puts default values in others. When this happens, focus goes to the last EditText that was given a default value (and sometimes makes the screen scroll). I would like no focus to change. Is there a way to prevent focus change while the screen is resetting? </p>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
As requested, here is a sample of my layout file which demonstrates how views are organized (full file was 700+ lines). All EditTexts are nested like these examples. Notice that my EditTexts are nested either 1 or 2 layers within the RelativeLayout within the ScrollView. Therefore, for their common parent, they are grandchildren or great grandchildren. </p>

<p>Directly from Android Docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>public final boolean requestFocus ()</p>
<p>Added in API level 1 Call this to try to give focus to a specific view
or to one of its descendants. A view will not actually take focus if
it is not focusable (isFocusable() returns false), or if it is
focusable and it is not focusable in touch mode
(isFocusableInTouchMode()) while the device is in touch mode. See also
focusSearch(int), which is what you call to say that you have focus,
and you want your parent to look for the next one. This is equivalent
to calling requestFocus(int, Rect) with arguments FOCUS_DOWN and null.</p>

focus.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. If you are using dynamic views and do not have an xml file with all the EditText's you will have to wait until after your entire view has been created before getting the child count because it would return 0 by default since this parent layout would know nothing about dynamic views.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.06307519640852974,0.2,0.16666666666666666,1,1

Here is my scenario:
I need to do load testing using Jmeter master slave set up. I am planning to launch the master and slave nodes on AWS (window boxes, dependency on one of the tool I launch via jmeter). I want to launch these master-slave set up in AWS on demand where I can tell how many slave nodes I want. I looked around a lot of blogs around using Jmeter with AWS and everywhere they assume these nodes will be launched manually and needs further configuration for master and slave nodes to talk to each other. For the tests where we might have 5 or 10 slave nodes this will be fine but for my tests I want to launch 50 instances(again the tool I use with jmeter has limitation that forces me to use each jmeter slave node as 1 user, instead of using 1 slave node to act as multiple users) like this and manually updating each of the slave nodes will be very cumbersome. So I was wondering if anybody else ran into this issue and have any suggestions. In the mean time I am looking into other solutions that will help me to use same slave node to mimic multiple users, which will help me to reduce the need to launch these many slave nodes. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>","<p>After some discussion in your question's comments we were able to break down your problem to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are rendering a list of items. This list is an array of objects.</li>
<li>There is some functionality in the rendered item that allows you to change the corresponding object in the array.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But how is it possible to update the corresponding object in the array?</strong></p>
<p>Below is a snippet demonstrating a solution.</p>

<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Here is the outline of the solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>To update the array we need to find the index of the item you want to update then update it.</li>
</ul>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""></pre>
<ul>
<li>The component is actually passed the items as a value in the prop , however it is not recommended that you mutate props directly</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, every time the parent component is updated, all props in the child component will be refreshed with the latest value. This means you should not attempt to mutate a prop inside a child component. If you do, Vue will warn you in the console.</p>

<p>Therefore we create a proxy of the items in the component's data method.</p>

<p>All mutations of data in  will occur in .</p>
<p>Hopefully the above will help resolve your issue. However one suggestion I would make:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may be better to break down your list items into their own components. This will mean every item will have their own scope, you won't have to proxy the items and you won't have to do complicated splicing and object creation with spread.</p>

<p>Regarding <em>point number 1</em>.
It is clear (to me at least) that you have some background in programming and the ideas of algorithms and functions are not entirely new to you.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is quite obvious that you are somewhat new to Python.</p>
<p>Python should be an easy to write - easy to understand language.

string is already an  object. That means you can just do
this:</p>

<p>And assuming that  is a string, everything will go as planned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Readability.</strong></p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This line of code is used to decide the content of the  string in the  place and handles both uppercase and lowercase cases.</p>
<p>I bet that you will agree with me that</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>is much more readable. So in combo with my previous note, all you have to do beforehand is  which will make all letters lowercase and reduce the number of comparisons by half (this 'half' prediction is not <em>entirely</em> correct but you get the idea).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use built in mechanisms.</strong></p>

<p>This line passes the whole string as a parameter plus a numeric parameter which tells the function from where to start. The best practice here is to use . This mechanism allows you to pass only a  or a window if you will, of the original string. That way you don't need the extra numeric parameter.
If I want the next call to the function to iterate over the string starting from the  location I can just do:</p>

719,Making a Javascript click function for model objects formatted in Django Tables2 that shows related divs,"<p>I'm trying to make a Javascript function involving a django-tables2 table featuring model objects that will show relevant information when clicked. Here is the relevant code:</p>

<pre></pre>
<p>views.py</p>

<p>What I want to do is make a Javascript function that's basically like this: As you can see, the ""detailed"" class divs are hidden from the start. When you click on a row in the model object table, the ""detailed"" class div with an id that matches that of the row (or basically corresponds with the same model object in both the table loop and the second loop) will show, and the rest will still be hidden. I hope that it's clear.</p>","<p>As a sidenote, if the queryset used in the table is the same as  there is no need to pass  separately to the template context, you can just use .</p>
<p>I would hide the  blocks using CSS, and not using JavaScript, as if you do use JavaScript, they might be visible for a slight moment when the page loads.</p>
<p>You should try to avoid adding  attributes to too much html elements. In your example, you add the student id as an  attribute to both the table 's and the  elements. The HTML spec <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">requires ID's to be unique in the whole document</a>, so if you want to use them, make sure they are unique.</p>
<p>It's better to use data attributes. In the example below, I added the attribute  to both the table row and the  element. You can now select  to get the details div element for student with id = 12:</p>

724,How To Secure Erlang Cluster Behind Private Subnet,"<p>I am testing Erlang and have a few questions related to Security of the Distribution.  (There is a lot of mixed information out there)  These type of questions come with lots of opinions related to situations, and depends on personal comfort level on the type of data you are dealing with.  For the sake of this question, lets assume it is a simple chat server where users can connect to and chat together.</p>
<p>Example Diagram: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbXov.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbXov.png""/></a></p>
<p>The cluster will be behind a private subnet VPC with elastic-load-balancing directing all connections to these nodes (to and from).  The elastic-load-balancing will be the only direct path to these nodes (there would be no way to connect to a node via name@privatesubnet).</p>
<p>My question is the following:</p>
<p>Based on this question and answer: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32328314/distributed-erlang-security-how-to"">Distributed erlang security how to?</a></p>
<p>There are two different types of inner-communication that can take place.  Either, directly connecting nodes using built in functionality, or doing everything over a TCP connection with a custom protocol.  The first is the most easiest, but I believe it comes with a few security issues, and I was wondering based on the above diagram if It would be good enough (Er, okay, Good Enough is not always good when dealing with sensitive information, but there can always be better ways to do everything ...)</p>
<p>How do you secure and Erlang cluster behind a private subnet?  I would like to hide the nodes, and manually connect them, and of course use cookies on them.  Is there any flaws with this approach?  And since a custom protocol using TCP would be the best option, what type of impact does that have on performance?  I want to know the potential security flaws(As I said, there is a lot of mixed information out there on how to do this).</p>
<p>I would be interested in hearing from people who have used Erlang in this manner!</p>","<p>On AWS, with your EC2 nodes in a private subnet, you are pretty safe from unwanted connections to your nodes. You can verify this by trying to connect (in any way) to the machines running your code: if you're using a private subnet you will be unable to do so because the instances are not even addressable outside the subnet.</p>
<p>Your load-balancer should not be forwarding Erlang node traffic.</p>
<p>You can do a little better than the above using some security-group rules. Configure your nodes to use <a href=""http://erlang.org/faq/how_do_i.html#idp32796752"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some range of ports</a>. Then make a group ""erlang"" that allows connections to that port range from the ""erlang"" group and denies the connection otherwise. Finally, assign that security-group to all your Erlang-running instances. This prevents instances that don't need to talk to Erlang from being able to do so.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.015488215488215488,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0,0

<p>Basically we create a mosca server and an http server and attach the http server to Mosca. After that how do we really use it? Will REST requests coming to the http server be redirected to mosca? How does the connection, pubsub take place?</p>
<p>Any example use case on how this can be used? </p>","<p>Mosca is using the httpServer to handle the websocket handshake in order to support MQTT over Websockets. This is for use with things like the Paho <a href=""https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">javascript client</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a HTTP REST to MQTT bridge.</p>
<p>You can attach your own endpoints to the httpServer so you can provide your own REST API or server up static content that will use the Paho client to connect to the mosca broker in order to consume and publish messages.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.029180695847362513,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0,0

<p>Can we assume that next hash codes will be will unique across different physical machines?</p>","<p>A hash can, by <em>definition</em>, never be unique, ever. A hash maps a larger (potentially infinite) input space to a smaller (usually finite) output space. The Pigeonhole Principle says that there <em>must</em> be multiple input values that map to the same output value. (If you're not familiar with the Pigeonhole Principle, it is <em>really</em> simple: if you have three pairs of socks and two drawers, then no matter how you distribute the socks among the drawers there must be <em>at least one</em> drawer with <em>at least two</em> pairs of socks in it.)</p>
<p>There are infinitely many possible Scala objects but only finitely many hash codes, therefore, there must be at least one hash code that has infinitely many objects that map to it. In fact, since hash codes are usually written in such a way that they are well-distributed, <em>every</em> hash code will have infinitely many objects that map to it.</p>
<p>s are s. Which means that there are <em>exactly</em> as many s as there are s. So, if s <em>were</em> unique, then there wouldn't be any s left over for all the other objects (s, s, s, s, s, s, s, s, s, s, and so on and so forth).

772,How Camera works in Libgdx and together with Viewport,"<p>If you work with LibGdx it goes not long until you come to Camera and viewport. If you work the first time with camera and Viewport you get some questions about how it works and how to use it. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I use a Camera in LibGdx? What's viewport width and height?</li>
<li>What is a Viewport, how can I use it and how it works together with the Camera?</li>
</ul>","<h2>How can I use a Camera in LibGdx? What's viewport width and height?</h2>
<p>Firstly it's important that you know the Camera works with World units not with Pixels. World units are not a regular Unit. You self can define how much one World Unit is. Later more.</p>
<p>First, we create an  a  and a :</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>We create a  and in the Constructor we define how many World Units we see if we look through this camera into our world. In our example 50 x 50 World Units these are the viewport width and height.
So we have created a Camera with a viewport width and height of 50.</p>
<p>In the render() method we render our image:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>(1) Clear the Screen, if we don't do that every Texture will draw over the other and if we draw a Animation we will see the old Frames.</p>
<p>(2) The  is our Drawer he draws our Images, Animations etc. Default he draws a World which has so many World Units like the Screen has Pixels so in this case 1 World Unit = 1 Pixel. But now we will see 50 x 50 World Units doesn't matter how big the screen is. To say the Batch that he should draw what we see through our camera we must call: </p>
<p>(3) Now we draw our  on Position 0,0 But 0, 0 doesn't mean on Pixel position 0,0 it means the Image will be drawn on World position 0,0 also width and height are not in Pixels they are in World units so the  will be drawn on Position 0,0 25x25 World Units big. So on a 50x50 viewport, the image fills one-quarter of the whole screen.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ygxgx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ygxgx.png""/></a></p>
<p>The Image fill one-quarter of the whole screen exactly as expected. But why it is on the right top and not on the bottom left?</p>
<p>The Problem is that the center of the Camera point on the position 0,0
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9POj.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9POj.png""/></a></p>
<p>So our Image is drawn on position 0,0 he fills the top right corner.
We must set the position of the camera so 0,0 is in the bottom left corner:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In the render() method we must add  because every time we change the position or the scale or what else of the camera we must update the camera.</p>
<p>Now the Image is in the bottom left.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the Pixels?</strong></p>
<p>We always speak about World units but where are the Pixels? The pixels are still there. If we have a Screen size of 200 x 200 pixels the batch will always draw 200 x 200 pixels. With the method  we only say the batch how much World Units are one Pixel.</p>
<p>If we have a Screen with 200 x 200 pixels and we create a Camera with a viewport of 50 x 50 world units the SpriteBatch know 1 WorldUnit = 4 Pixels.
Now we draw a Image which is 25 x 25 World Units big the SpriteBatch knows he must draw the image 25 * 4 = 100 pixel big.</p>
<p>So the pixels still there but it's easier to think in World Units.
If it's not clear enough here is a little bit more detailed description: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51993577/libgdxs-world-units/52072708#52072708"">Libgdx's World Units</a></p>
<p><strong>Box2d</strong></p>
<p>It's also very important to think in World Units if you use Box2d because Box2d works with Meters. So if you create a Body with a Force off 5 on the x axis, the Body is 5 m/s fast.</p>
<p>And now it's very cool to work with World Units because you can say 1 World Unit = 1 Meter so you can create a object with a width of 10 and you know after one second the Body will be in the Center of the Object. If you work with Pixels you will have a Problem if you have a different Screensize.</p>
<h2>What is a Viewport, how can I use it and how it works together with the Camera?</h2>
<p>Now we have the big Problem about different Screen sizes.
Suddenly we have a Screen size of 350 x 200 pixels, now the Image will be stretched and don't look so nice as before.</p>
<p>For this Problem we use Viewports a few Viewports are ,  and . All viewports you can find here: <a href=""https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Viewports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Viewports</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly what is a Viewport.</p>
<p>Imagine the camera is a speaker who speaks English. Different Screen Sizes are other People who speak German, French, Chinese etc. and the Viewport is the translator. The Translator doesn't change the sense of that what the English Speaker says but he adapts it so the others can understand it. Same are camera and Viewport. Viewport doesn't say or change what you can see on your screen if you run the program. He only handles that you always see the same on different Screen sizes. A Camera can life without Viewport. A Viewport not without Camera.</p>
<p>Add a viewport Object: </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>and the resize() method:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p><strong>StretchViewport</strong></p>
<p>Create a StretchViewport:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In the StretchViewport Constructor, we define the viewport width and height and the Camera.</p>
<p>Now we get the same result as before if we have different Screensizes the Images will be stretched.</p>
<p><strong>FitViewport</strong></p>
<p>Maybe we won't stretch our Images we will matter about the ratio of x and y.</p>
<p>The ratio of x and y means: is an Object 2 width and 1 height he will always twice as wide as high for example 200x100, 30x15 but not 20x15.</p>
<p>Create a FitViewport:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Now the Image will always be a square. To see the Bars on the Side lets draw the Image as big as our viewport:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzxDr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rzxDr.png""/></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARZX1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARZX1.png""/></a></p>
<p>The Image has a Ratio of 1 because of 50(width)/50(height) = 1 so the Image will always have the same width and height. The Bars on the side are outside of our Viewport and will be drawn in the color you define here: </p>
<p><strong>ExtendViewport</strong></p>
<p>Maybe we won't Bars on the Side then we can take a ExtendViewport. The ExtendViewport keeps the world aspect ratio without bars by extending the world in one direction. Means on a screen where the aspect ratio between width and height are bigger you will see more of the world.</p>
<p>On a screen 400x200 aspect ration = (400/200 = 2) you will see more than on a screen of 300x200 (300/200 = 1.5);</p>
<p>To show this create a ExtendViewport and draw the Image bigger than the viewport and a second small Image:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>If we now start our Program with a Screen size of 200x200 we see:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwBcw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwBcw.png""/></a></p>
<p>And if we resize the Screen on x axis To make the screen wider:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tZnNl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""enter image description here"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tZnNl.png""/></a></p>
<p>Now we can see more off the first Image and additinal the Second image but the ratio will always be the same. The Image is only stretched because we draw it 100x50 not because of resizing.</p>
<p>I hope this will clear some Questions about Camera and Viewport if you will learn more, read and look some tutorials and read the LibGdx wiki: <a href=""https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki</a></p>",0.0,0.8333333333333333,0.05948372615039281,0.0,0.0,0,1

803,"Positioning UIScrollView scrollIndicatorInsets to edges, no spacing?","<p>How does the ScrollView.scrollIndicatorInsets actually work ?</p>
<p>If you set all insets to 0 as default, and you do some debugging you will actually find that the scrollbar isn't exactly near the bottom or right edges by default as it should be. </p>
<pre></pre>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IpSlY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img alt=""Example"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IpSlY.png""/></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there is some extra spacing between the scrollbar and the scroll view edges. </p>
<p><strong>Is there any way that I can place the scrollbar bottom left corner exactly at the bottom left corner of the view programatically ?</strong> I don't want to hardcode anything, I want it to work on any scrollview size and screen. </p>
<p>What do the insets actually specify (yes, I know they specify a rectangle for the scrollbar) ? Is there a default spacing-to-edge that iOS uses for the scrollbar and I have to take that into consideration ? Is there glow on the scrollbar's layer view, hence the spacing ?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>I solved this using the non-convential approach by accessing the UIView from the scrollbar itself (subviews.last), and using the smallest size (which is the thickness).</p>","<p>Quick inspection shows the Scroll Indicators with Insets set to  (the default) places them 3-pts from the edges.</p>
<p>You can try using:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>which <em>should</em> align the horizontal indicator flush to the bottom, and flush with the left and right edges, and the vertical indicator flush to the right, and flush with the top and bottom edges.</p>
<p>You <em>might</em> want to get the frame(s) first though, as it's possible it varies between devices / sizes / iOS versions.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>A couple clarifying notes...</p>
<p>The  are image views. You can find them by inspecting the scroll view's subviews (code or with Debug View Hierarchy).</p>
<p>The default insets (of Zero) put those image views 3-pts from the edge of the scroll view's frame.</p>
<p>With a  scroll view, the origin of the vertical indicator is: </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>and the origin of the horizontal indicator is:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So, using:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>moves the origins to </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>I suppose it's <em>possible</em> that could change in the future. As fewer and fewer people use devices with small screens, Apple <em>could</em> change the width/height to 3 or 3.5 or whatever, and <em>could</em> change the default inset from 3 to something else. Which is why I said you might want to get the frames to get the proper inset values, rather than hard-coding them to .</p>
<p>Curiously, though, until the indicator frames have been drawn to the screen - either by flashing them or actually scrolling the content - their frames are set to 7-pts in height (for the vertical indicator) and 7-pts width (for the horizontal), and positioned at the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>So, with the  scroll view frame, the indicator frames are initially:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>That still tells you they are 3-pts from the edges, but it's not quite as clear... and again, no guarantee that won't change in the future.</p>
<p>If you really want sure the indicators will go where you want them, your best bet may be to use custom views instead of the built-in indicators.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.02312008978675645,0.0,0.0,1,1

<p>Why is the first case silent if the second case complains?</p>","<p>Because you tried to create a floating point number that is larger that the largest value representable in a floating point value.</p>
<p>See the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.float_info"" rel=""nofollow""> named tuple</a>;  is the largest value representable in such values. Python floats, unlike Python integers, have an upper limit determined by your OS and hardware platform, integers are limited by your available memory.</p>
<p>On my Mac, that maximum value is:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So a 1 with 308 zeros is representable, but a 2 with that many zeros is not:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Floats are limited because floating point arithmetic is typically handled by the floating point unit on your CPU, and Python's float type is limited to what that piece of hardware can handle.</p>
<p>Defining a float <em>literal</em> is a different operation from applying arithmetic to a floating point value; the first is determined at compile time, the latter is determined at <em>runtime</em>. A literal could only produce a  exception, while at runtime you can throw other exceptions. But throwing a syntax error for a float literal that on other platforms could still be valid is not really an option, so instead of an exception you get  instead.</p>

The two threads are supposed to synchronize using the two std::atomic variables 's_lock1' and 's_lock2'.

However, somehow in func1 it's printing the unexpected ""bad"" output.  The s_lock2.load() statement seems to return false instead.  Is there something wrong with this code snippet?

<p>Atomic operations tagged  not only order memory the same way as release/acquire ordering (everything that happened-before a store in one thread becomes a visible side effect in the thread that did a load), but <strong>also establish a single total modification order of all atomic operations that are so tagged</strong>. Sequential ordering may be necessary for multiple producer-multiple consumer situations where all consumers must observe the actions of all producers occurring in the same order. Total sequential ordering requires a full memory fence CPU instruction on all multi-core systems. This may become a performance bottleneck since it forces the affected memory accesses to propagate to every core.</p>

Now, since this release in for Kafka 0.10 +, most of the load from ZK would be taken off since the offsets won't be stored in ZK.</p>
<p>Considering this, does it make sense for us to also start looking at Pacemaker to reduce load further on ZK? </p>
<p>Our cluster has 70+ supervisor and around 70 workers with a few unused slots. Also, we have around 9100+ executors/tasks running. </p>
<p>Another question I have is regarding the heartbeats and who all send it to whom? From what I have read, workers and supervisors send their heartbeats to ZK, which is what Pacemaker alleviates. How about the tasks? Do they also send heartbeats? If yes, then is it to ZK or where else? There's this config called <strong>task.heartbeat.frequency.secs</strong> which has led me to some more confusion. </p>
<p>The reason I ask this is that if the task level heartbeats aren't being sent to ZK, then its pretty evident that Pacemaker won't be needed.

844,How does single-threaded Node.js handles requests concurrently?,"<p>I am currently deeply learning Nodejs platform. As we know, Nodejs is single-threaded, and if it executes blocking operation (for example fs.readFileSync), a thread should wait to finish that operation. I decided to make an experiment: I created a server that responses with the huge amount of data from a file on each request</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-babel=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-hide=""false"" data-lang=""js"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override""></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Also, I launched 5 terminals in order to do parallel requests to a server. I waited to see that while one request is being handled, the others should wait for finishing blocking operation from the first request. However, the other 4 requests were responded concurrently. Why does this behavior occur?</p>","<p>What you're likely seeing is either some asynchronous part of the implementation inside of  to actually send your large amount of data or you are seeing all the data get sent very quickly and serially, but the clients can't process it fast enough to actually show it serially and because the clients are each in their own separate process, they ""appear"" to show it arriving concurrently just because they're too slow reacting to show the actually arrival sequence.  </p>
<p>One would have to use a network sniffer to see which of these is actually occurring or run some different tests or put some logging inside the implementation of  or tap into some logging inside the client's TCP stack to determine the actual order of packet arrival among the different requests.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you have one server and it has one request handler that is doing synchronous I/O, then you will not get multiple requests processes concurrently.  If you believe that is happening, then you will have to document exactly how you measured that or concluded that (so we can help you clear up your misunderstanding) because that is not how node.js works when using blocking, synchronous I/O such as .</p>
<p>node.js runs your JS as single threaded and when you use blocking, synchronous I/O, it blocks that one single thread of Javascript.  That's why you should never use synchronous I/O in a server, except perhaps in startup code that only runs once during startup.</p>
<p>What is clear is that  is synchronous so your second request will not get started processing until the first  is done.  And, calling it on the same file over and over again will be very fast (OS disk caching).</p>
<p>But,  is non-blocking, asynchronous.   is a stream and you're giving the stream some data to process.  It will send out as much as it can over the socket, but if it gets flow controlled by TCP, it will pause until there's more room to send on the socket.  How much that happens depends upon all sorts of things about your computer, it's configuration and the network link to the client.</p>
<p>So, what could be happening is this sequence of events:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First request arrives and does  and calls .  That starts sending data to the client, but returns before it is done because of TCP flow control.  This sends node.js back to its event loop.</p></li>
<li><p>Second request arrives and does  and calls . That starts sending data to the client, but returns before it is done because of TCP flow control.  This sends node.js back to its event loop.</p></li>
<li><p>At this point, the event loop might start processing the third or fourth requests or it might service some more events (from inside the implementation of  or the writeStream from the first request to keep sending more data.  If it does service those events, it could give the appearance (from the client point of view) of true concurrency of the different requests).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the client could be causing it to appear sequenced.  Each client is reading a different buffered socket and if they are all in different terminals, then they are multi-tasked.  So, if there is more data on each client's socket than it can read and display immediately (which is probably the case), then each client will read some, display some, read some more, display some more, etc...  If the delay between sending each client's response on your server is smaller than the delay in reading and displaying on the client, then the clients (which are each in their own separate processes) are able to run concurrently.</p>
<hr/>

<p>A few more tips on how to keep developing manageable:</p>
<ul>
<li>use shorter classnames (you only need one specific longer class or id to apply your CSS to specific elements. So use shorter classnames for its children.</li>
<li>do not copy/paste transition or transforms over different states of the same element. Just place them on the state that's always active and only override the property that changes. It really improves animation performance and also increases your ability to understand and control it.</li>
<li>only prefix your properties after you're done developing, as a last step; otherwise, they'll clutter up your ""workspace"" without adding anything, really;</li>
<li>when you don't have a reason to use , use . If you want your slider's paddings and margins to be affected by 's  use . If you want it fixed to whatever you set on slider, use  (and set  on your slider).</li>

871,function pointer and virtual function,"<p>I guess my question should be silly but it is true that I have never seen a function pointer that is declared as virtual. Is there a reason for this? </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I should have said: Is it possible that the function it points to is specified as virtual?</p>","<p>Well, yes (and no). </p>
<p>Ordinary function pointers cannot point to non-static member functions. They can only point to standalone functions, which is why for ordinary function pointers the matter of function virtuality does not even come into the picture.</p>
<p>In order to point to member functions in C++ you need a pointer of special kind: one that has pointer-to-member-function type. A pointer of this type can point to non-virtual member functions as well and to virtual member functions. There are no special steps to take if you want to point to virtual member function. For example</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>However, when you make such pointer to point to a virtual member function, you have to keep in mind that it is does not really get tied to a specific version of that function in the class hierarchy. The decision about the specific function to call is made at the point of the call. For example</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In the above example we made out pointer  to point to . Or did we? In reality  the pointer is not hard-linked to  specifically. These two calls</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>will call two different functions. The first one will call  for object , while the second one will call  for object , even though we used the same pointer value in both cases. This makes sense actually in many applications.</p>
<p>Yet, in some low-level situation it would be useful to have a pointer that is hard-tied to a specific version of virtual function. I.e. it would be nice to have a pointer that would call  for  subobject of object  when we do</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>To achieve that we need to be able to specify whether we want to bind it early (at the point of initialization) or late (at the point of the call). Unfortunately, C++ language provides no such functionality. </p>",0.0,0.0,0.17710437710437713,0.0,0.0,0,1

883,Conditional tuning of hyperparameters with RandomizedSearchCV in scikit-learn,"<p>I want to use RandomizedSearchCV in sklearn to search for the optimal hyperparameter values for a support vector classifier on my dataset. The hyperparameters I am optimising are ""kernel"", ""C"" and ""gamma"". However, in the case of a ""poly"" kernel, I would also like to optimise a fourth hyperparameter, ""degree"" (the index of the polynomial kernel function). </p>
<p>I realise that since the degree hyperparameter is ignored when the kernel is not ""poly"", I could just include degree in the params dictionary I provide to RandomizedSearchCV (as I've done in the code below). However, ideally I would like to search uniformely across the non-poly kernels plus each degree of poly kernel, i.e. I want to sample uniformly across e.g. [(kernel=""linear""), (kernel=""rbf""), (kernel=""poly"", degree=2), (kernel=""poly"", degree=3)]. Therefore, I was wondering if it is possible to conditionally introduce a hyperparameter for tuning, i.e. if kernel=""poly"" degree=np.linspace(2, 5, 4), else degree=0.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find an example of this in the RandomizedSearchCV documentation, and so was wondering if anybody here had come across the same issue and would be able to help. Thanks!</p>

I am having trouble converting these to any sort of SQL Date format so that I can do a query using Like on the Date field so I can find the closest date to the requested one.</p>
<p>For an overview of what I am doing, I have a aspx page that has 2 date pickers on it. The user selects a start and end date, that is converted into the same format as used in the database (ddd MM  d or ddd MM dd) I then use a MIN/MAX select to find the lowest matching ID and highest matching ID to the dates supplied. That works fine, IF that date passed in has records. However, I want to convert the date stored in the database to a format where I can do a select first date after the passed in date, and the last date before the end passed date so I can return all of the rows in between. To achieve that I need to get the date into a format I can work with in SQL rather than just a nvarchar as its stored now.</p>

<pre></pre>
<p>Now I stumbled upon unusual situation. 
<br/>I want to use this interlocked ""read"" on a <strong>read-only</strong> (write-protected) memory page. The result is <strong>""Access violation writing location x""</strong>... </p>
<p>So I guess this is by design? I understand that  is often a used as a ""write"" instruction. But why is access violation trigger included in this particular case?</p>
<p>What are the alternatives to  in order to perform interlocked read?</p>
<p><br/><strong>Update:</strong> I tried using </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>when I know that the value at <em>ptr</em> is never negative, but this triggers the access violation also, even though in this case there certainly isn't any writing going on. So I guess this is by design with this instruction... 
<br/>But why and how to get around that?</p>
<p><br/><strong>Update2:</strong> More details about why I started using interlocked reads.
<br/>I left my question intentionally vague. I am generally interested in the topic, that is - both skipping the cache and having atomic reads, including atomic 64-bit reads.</p>
<p>The reason why I started wondering is that <strong>.NET</strong> uses  for interlocked reading inside <br/> <br/>method.
<br/>The MSDN states for this .NET  method: <strong>""The Read method is unnecessary on 64-bit systems, because 64-bit read operations are already atomic. On 32-bit systems, 64-bit read operations are not atomic unless performed using Read.""</strong></p>
<p>Also, MSDN states for (C-language)  function that unaligned operations are not permitted in any case: <strong>""The variables for this function must be aligned on a 64-bit boundary; otherwise, this function will behave unpredictably on multiprocessor x86 systems and any non-x86 systems""</strong>. 
<br/>So according to that text also .NET should never have unaligned Int64 variables. But then why interlocked reading?</p>","<p>The memory must be writable in case the comparison succeeds. This is true even if you know that it won't succeed due to your program logic. On x86, this is enforced by the processor. According to the processor documentation, the  instruction <a href=""http://www.jaist.ac.jp/iscenter-new/mpc/altix/altixdata/opt/intel/vtune/doc/users_guide/mergedProjects/analyzer_ec/mergedProjects/reference_olh/mergedProjects/instructions/instruct32_hh/vc42.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generates a write cycle even if the comparison fails</a>.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the intention of the interlocked operation is. If you merely want to read the value atomically (<em>i.e.</em>, without tearing), then you can simply issue a read, because properly aligned reads and writes are already atomic. If you want to access the memory with specific semantics, you can stick a , , , or fence before/after the instruction as desired. <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kangsu/archive/2007/07/16/volatile-acquire-release-memory-fences-and-vc2005.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starting in Visual Studio 2005</a>, volatile reads are performed with acquire semantics and volatile writes are performed with release semantics.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0675645342312009,0.0,0.0,1,1

908,"Are ""best practices"" regarding connection handle re-use and database user design mutually exclusive?","<p>SO says this may be subjective.  I'm hoping not--I just can't seem to understand how this works in practice, and it seems like a specific enough technical question with I hope a definitive answer.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> LAPP stack.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I've read that using a single database user as the login for all connections to the database, and handling security yourself from there, is a bad idea.  Databases have sufficient security models and it makes sense to use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Database handles have some resource cost associated with them, hence the existence of Apache::DBI, DBIx::Connector, and DBI::connect_cached(), to re-use a recent connection to a database.  Making use of them should make a web app faster by avoiding the cost of connecting to a database.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The reason these seem to be mutually exclusive best practices is that, in my understanding, #1 implies that any database connection will be made with separate per-user credentials, which implies (as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20475956/should-i-disconnect-if-im-using-apachedbis-connect-cached"">Apache::DBI documents</a>) that re-using such connections will likely quickly cause your database backend to run out of connections.</p>
<p>The default maximum number of connections for PostgreSQL is 100.</p>
<p>The default numbers of servers and multiplied by subprocesses allowed for each, for Apache 2 running with the prefork MPM, far exceeds that, so it seems Apache::DBI's docs are right.</p>
<p><strong>Thus the question</strong>: What do people do then, in practice?</p>
<p>Does this mean people using a LAPP stack generally connect using a single database user, and implement their own security/permissions model?  Or does it mean they don't pool connections?  Or do they choose between these two strategies based on speed vs security needs if they go with a LAPP stack, and if they need both, go with a desktop app or some other connection model?</p>
<p>Or if these are not, in fact, mutually exclusive strategies, what am I missing in my understanding here?</p>","<blockquote>

<p>You probably misread this, or read it in a highly biased location. A more balanced view is (hopefully) this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Managing perms (ACL or RBAC or other) within the database is a bloody mess and hard to get right. It can cripple performance, too, if done improperly (think: ""select * from table join perms where convoluted_permission_scenario"".) Depending on who you ask, you'll get more or less extreme viewpoints, e.g. here's (the very controversial) Zed Shaw: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/2723800"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/2723800</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing perms at the DB level is just as much of a bloody mess. Not all engines implement row-level permissions, and even then there occasionally are leaks. For instance, calling a function in a where clause could (can?) leak rows in Postgres (until a recent version?) if  gets called. And frankly, if you go past a superficial analysis of what is going on, it basically amounts to the former — just standardized and (usually) in C.</p></li>
<li><p>Managing perms at the app level <em>without</em> a database is <em>also</em> a bloody mess. It'll cripple performance no matter what you do from the moment where you need to join outside of SQL, unless you're dealing with trivial amounts of data. If you try it, you'll do fine… until your database grows too large and you basically don't.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, in short: it's a bloody mess no matter where you manage it. Because permissions <em>are</em> a mess. In addition to the casual and idealistic ""Joe needs write access to this set of nodes"", you also need to cope with more down to earth scenarios such as ""John is going off on vacation for Christmas and needs to temporarily delegate his write permissions on this set of nodes to his assistant Jane"". Moreover, whichever scenario you do pick, you <em>need</em> to manage read access (which is usually the most frequent) in such a way that it's fast so you can scale. There's no silver bullet.</p>
<p>Moreover, even in the first and last of the above scenarios, it's ideal to have three DB users. One for reads, one for read/writes, and one for schema changes. Most apps don't, because it's yet another bloody mess to configure your ORM that way, hence the typical one DB user per app.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to your question: what people do in practice is one or two database users (read vs read/write/modify), implement RBAC or ACL within the database itself, and avoid access restriction logic like the plague on public-facing pages for performance reasons.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0244668911335578,0.0,0.0,0,1

Whenever I spawn more than one of an enemy, only the first one registers any collision detection; all other enemies seem to be merely visual ""ghosts"" that are rendered to the screen. When the first enemy dies, the only one that can, then all other ""ghosts"" disappear along with it.</p>
<p>I've created an enemy manager class that uses a vector list to hold active enemies, check each one's collision against any box passed in, and update/render the enemies.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The enemy class itself is pretty basic; cEnemy is the base class, from which cMeleeEnemy is derived. It has the standard hp, dmg, and movement variables so that it can crawl around the screen to try and collide with the player's avatar and also respond to being attacked by the player. All of this works fine, it's just that when I try to have multiple enemies, only the first one spawned in works correctly while the rest are empty shells, just textures on the screen. It doesn't matter if I make explicit calls to spawnMob rapidly in the same block or if I space them out dynamically with a timer; the result is the same.

939,MasterDetail and NavigationPage deeplinking in Prism Forms,"<p>I am testing the deeplinking feature of the Prism Forms framework. I currently have a situation where I have a MasterDetailPage with a menu as Master. When I click the menu items, the Details should change to specific pages with a clean NavigationPage as container.</p>
<p>When I check the <a href=""https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/tree/master/Sandbox/Xamarin/HelloWorld"" rel=""nofollow"">Sandbox example</a> for Prism Forms, it shows an example for MasterDetail navigation, but not including navigation pages.</p>
<p>So I have this (absolute) deeplink structure at startup: /MasterDetailPage/NavigationPage/MyFirstPage</p>
<p>Then I want the second menu item to link to a fresh NavigationPage:
/MasterDetailPage/NavigationPage/MySecondPage</p>
<p>My current workaround is to do absolute deeplinking, but I was wondering if there is a better way? The Prism PageNavigationService checks to see if the segment type is the same as the current detail type. But since these are both NavigationPages, it tries to add the new page in the already existing NavigationPage. At that moment it also kills the menu-icon (at least on iOS).</p>","<p>Actually, the Sandbox app does use NavigationPages in the MasterDetail: <a href=""https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/blob/master/Sandbox/Xamarin/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/Views/MyMasterDetail.xaml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/blob/master/Sandbox/Xamarin/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/HelloWorld/Views/MyMasterDetail.xaml</a></p>
<p>Prism reuses the detail page for performance reasons, but it doesn't work like you think it does.  While it does add the new page to the NavigationPage's NavigationStack, it also removes the previous page from the stack.  This keeps the NavigationStack in the proper state.</p>
<p>The icon behavior you are seeing is because of a confirmed bug in Xamarin.Forms.  You can follow the issue here: <a href=""https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41038"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41038</a></p>

I figure potential options outside of that might be running the cfquery on all of the data on this page and having a ""show"" button that narrows things down (inefficient, would like to only query the data that I want), or figuring out a way to submit disabled objects with a throwaway value assigned to them that can be ignored on the form processing page....but I'm hoping some ninjas can tell me a ninja way to do it.</p>

<pre></pre>
<p>I should note I am using the free 32-bit version</p>","<p>I think this is all just a combination of the free-32bit memory limitation, the fact that your row counts are possibly large and the fact that (unavoidably) <em>something</em> must be pulled entirely into memory when retrieving data from a column, whether it is the column itself that gets entirely pulled in (in the non-nested case) or if its the nested-index column that gets entirely pulled in.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that kdb uses powers-of-two (buddy) memory allocation. Even if todays table only contains one more row than yesterdays, the memory requirements per column could double. Take a simple example:</p>
<p>In the free 32bit version (windows) you can create this many floats and it only uses ~1.07gb of memory</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>However, try to generate one extra float and you hit a memory limit</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So even a small amount of rows in the difference between one day and the next can be very significant if you're near the boundary of allocatable powers of two.</p>
<p>--DISCLAIMER-- the following is hacky and is only intended for debugging! </p>
<p>You can actually manually try to access the data from the nested list, though you may still have memory issues here anyway.</p>
<p>Create a nested table and splay it</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>You can try to read in the indices from the nested-index file</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So the indices for splitting the full list of floats (the col1# file) is index 3, index 5, 10 etc etc</p>
<p>Say I want the first 3 rows</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>then I know that I need the first 10 floats from the col1# file and need to split them at index 3 and 5. Then I can read the col1# file <em>partially</em> and split it correctly</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>But this is precisely what KDB does under the covers anyway so I suspect that you'll still have trouble even reading in the nested-index file in the first place.</p>
<p>Check this debug/hack and see if you can partially read that way. But obviously it's not a long-term solution!</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0931537598204265,0.0,0.0,1,1

991,Split a spliterator into N spliterators,"<p>While analyzing a colleague's Java 7 code from a few years ago, I found that he implemented a utility for traversing data, potentially in parallel. He called it , and it extended the  interface. Some of its new methods were awkwardly familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li> would give the exact size of the range; </li>
<li> would separate the range into 2 pieces, preferably, although not necessarily, similar in size (modifying the current range and creating a new one);</li>
<li> would separate the range into N sub-ranges, potentially attempting to make them as even as possible.</li>
<li>Although  was there from , its subtypes were merely throwing .</li>
</ul>
<p>What I said to myself was that this is definitely what we can now do with (subsized) spliterators, thus taking advantage of the stream API. However, the spliterator in Java 8 does not provide an easy approach to splitting into  parts.</p>
<p>With a recursive function, we can split it up to  parts with  recursion levels, but the approach is not as trivial when  is not a power of two, not to mention that it feels unnatural to keep a utility function just for the effect. </p>
<p>One might also say to simply avoid messing around with spliterators and let a stream do the splitting induced by forks during the actual processing, but the ForkJoin strategy might not be very adequate for the task, and does not guarantee that it will use the number of threads that we specifically wish to dedicate to the job. There could be cases of heavy tasks being performed on a small number of elements, in fact.</p>
<p>The question sums up to the following: having a spliterator with at least the characteristics SIZED and SUBSIZED, how can I split it into an exact number of spliterators?</p>","<p>The way to do it, which is not even that hacky and interoperates with the existing F/J support framework, is coding a spliterator <em>wrapper</em> which uses its own splitting policy. What you lose is the ability to leverage a natively random-access structure; you can only split by iterating over the inner splitetator's data set.</p>
<p>You can refer to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/24459776/1103872"">earlier answer</a> where I present the code which splits into batches of predetermined size; it is quite easy to adapt it to your case with just an appropriate constructor call.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.010998877665544332,0.0,0.0,1,0

<blockquote>
<p>From time to time the ISession will execute the SQL statements needed to synchronize the ADO.NET connection's state with the state of objects held in memory. This process, flush, occurs by default at the following points</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Except when you explicity , there <strong>are absolutely no guarantees about when the Session executes the ADO.NET calls</strong>, only the order in which they are executed. <strong>However, NHibernate does guarantee that the ISession.Find(..) methods will never return stale data;</strong> nor will they return the wrong data.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently. The <strong>FlushMode</strong> class defines three different modes: only flush at commit time (and only when the NHibernate ITransaction API is used), flush automatically using the explained routine (will only work inside an explicit NHibernate ITransaction), or never flush unless Flush() is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running units of work, where an ISession is kept open and disconnected for a long time (see Section 11.4, “Optimistic concurrency control”).</p>

Why?,"<p>I <a href=""https://gitlab.com/snippets/1660997"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wrote a test</a> for ZeroMQ to convince myself that it manages to map replies to the client independent from processing order, which would prove it thread safe.</p>
<p>It is a multi-threaded server, which just throws the received messages back at the sender. The client sends some messages from several threads and checks, if it receives the same message back. For multi-threading I use OpenMP.</p>
<p><strike>That test worked fine and </strike> I wanted to move on and re-implement it with <a href=""https://github.com/zeromq/zmqpp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ bindings</a> for ZeroMQ. <strike> And now</strike> it doesn't work <strike>in the same way anymore</strike>.</p>
<p>Here's the code with ZMQPP:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""></pre>
<p>The test blocks and doesn't get executed to the end. I played around with s a little bit and found out that only one change can ""fix"" it:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The code is still getting executed parallel in that case, but I have to divide the loop executions number by a number of my physical cores.</p>
<p><strong>Does anybody have a clue what's going on here?</strong></p>","<h2>Prologue: ZeroMQ is by-definition and by-design NOT Thread-Safe.</h2>
<p>This normally does not matter as there are some safe-guarding design practices, but situation here goes even worse, once following the proposed <strong></strong> design.</p>
<p>Having spent some time with ZeroMQ, your proposal headbangs due to violations on several principal things, that otherwise help distributed architectures to work smarter, than a pure <strong></strong> of monolithic code.</p>
<p>ZeroMQ convinces in ( almost ) every third paragraph to <strong>avoid</strong> sharing of resources. <strong>Zero-sharing</strong> is one of the ZeroMQ's fabulous scalable performance and minimised latency maxims, so to say in short.</p>
<p>So one has better to avoid sharing <strong></strong> instance at all ( unless one knows pretty well, why and how the things work under the hood ).</p>
<p>Thus an attempt to fire 1000-times ( almost ) in parallel ( well, not a true <strong></strong> ) some flow of events onto a shared instance of  ( the less once it was instantiated with default parameters and having none performance tuning adaptations ) will certainly suffer from doing the very opposite from what is, performance-wise and design-wise, recommended to do.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>What are some of the constraints, not to headbang into?</h2>
<p>1) <strong>Each </strong> instance has a limited amount of I/O-threads, that were created during the instantiation process. Once a fair design needs some performance-tuning, it is possible to increase such number of I/O-threads and data-pumps will work that better ( sure, none amount of data-pumps will salvage a poor, the less a disastrous design / architecture of a distributed computing system. <strong>This is granted.</strong> ).</p>
<p>2) <strong>Each </strong> instance has an { implicit | explicit } mapping onto a respective I/O-thread <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/43763559/3666197"">( Ref. 1) )</a>. Once a fair design needs some increased robustness against sluggish event-loop handlings or against other  adverse effects arisen from data-flow storms ( or load-balancing or you name it ), there are chances to benefit from a divide-and-conquer approach to use <strong></strong> method to directly map each  instance onto a respective I/O-thread, and remain thus in control of what buffering and internal queues are fighting for which resources during the real operations. In any case, where a total amount of threads goes over the localhost number of cores, the <strong>just-CONCURRENT scheduling is obvious</strong> ( so a dream of a true <strong></strong> execution is principally and inadvertently lost. <strong>This is granted.</strong> ).</p>
<p>3) <strong>Each </strong> has also a pair of <strong>""Hidden Queue Devastators""</strong>, called High-Watermarks. These get set either { implicitly | explicitly }, the latter being for sure a wiser manner for performance tuning. Why Devastators? Because these stabilise and protect the distributed computing systems from overflows and are permitted to simply discard each and every message above the <strong></strong> level(s) so as to protect the systems capability to run forever, even under heavy storms, spurious blasts of crippled packets or DDoS-types of attack. There are many tools for tuning this domain of ZeroMQ Context()-instance's behaviour, which go beyond the scope of this answer ( Ref.: other my posts on ZeroMQ  benefits or the ZeroMQ API specifications used in  method ).</p>
<p>4) <strong>Each  transport-class</strong> based  instance has also inherited some O/S dependent heritage. Some O/S demonstrate this risk by extended accumulation of ip-packets <strong>( outside of any ZeroMQ control )</strong> until some threshold got passed and thus a due design care ought be taken for such cases to avoid adverse effects on the intended application signalling / messaging dynamics and robustness against such uncontrollable ( exosystem ) buffering habits.</p>
<p>5) Each <strong></strong> and <strong></strong> method call is by-definition <strong>blocking</strong>, a thing a massively distributed computing system ought never risk to enter into. Never ever. Even in a school-book example. Rather use non-blocking form of these calls. Always. <strong>This is granted.</strong></p>
<p>6) <strong>Each </strong> instance ought undertake a set of careful and graceful termination steps. A preventive step of <strong></strong> + an explicit  <strong></strong> methods are fair to be required to be included in every use-case ( and made robust to get executed irrespective of any exceptions that may get appeared. ). A poor { self- | team- }-discipline in this practice is <strong>a sure ticket into hanging up the whole application infrastructure due to just not paying due care on a mandatory resources management policy. This is a must-have part of any serious distributed computing Project</strong>. Even the school-book examples ought have this. No exceptions. No excuse. <strong>This is granted.</strong></p>",0.0,0.5,0.02334455667789001,0.0,0.0,1,1

<pre></pre>","<p>The problem with your code is that everytime you click on "".addbutton"", you're going through all of the "".glyphcolor""s element's in your DOM and adding a new onclick event listener. The last one created will work, but the others will have multiple event listeners repeated (yes, this is possible). So, when you click on an element that has two events telling it to toggle the ""checkglyph1"" class, it will do it twice. And of course, it will not change at all. You can easily see this happening, because all the odd elements in your page must work (they will toggle the class by odd times), while the even ones must not.</p>
<p>This can be corrected by adding the event listener directly on the element when you create it on the page. The code below must work fine:</p>

<p>In this example code we do not specify the secret with which the

<p>So, why the result of ""1&gt;2"" is empty ? The book tells me that ""$a&gt;$b"" is 0 or 1 .</p>","<p>Ok, grab yourself a coffee, as it's time to go down the rabbit hole of perl and <a href=""https://perldoc.perl.org/Scalar/Util.html#dualvar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dualvars.</a></p>
<p>The thing that's happening here is - perl does some magic with 'boolean' values results. </p>
<p>As you may know - in perl ""false"" is (pretty much) anything that evaluates to zero or an empty string. </p>
<p>So  is false, but so is  (and a bunch of other things).</p>
<p>Perl usually infers from context, and the magic 'just works'.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>But... what about printing the result of your boolean? Well, as it turns out, because it could be <em>either</em> ""empty string"" or ""0"" perl creates a dualvar. </p>
<p>This is specifically a thing that has <em>both</em> values.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>If you tried these operations on a <em>normal</em> value:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>You would get </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>You can replicate this magic, using :</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Mostly you won't need to though - this is something that can do really odd things if you meddle too much. But often 'results' are dualvars, such as  and . </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This prints:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In the context of your question - it's because either empty string or zero are 'false' and perl doesn't know what kind of 'false' you'll be needing. So it gives you both. </p>
<p>And because you're doing a  perl decides that you're using strings now, and uses the string part of the dual var - the empty string. </p>
<p>You could instead do:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Adding zero forces a switch to 'numeric' and gives you:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>But the long and short of it really is - don't do what you're doing, it's bad style. If you need a particular value if something is false - then spell out what that value is. There's nothing wrong with:</p>

1070,Proving equality between instances of dependent types,"<p>When attempting to formalize the class which corresponds to an algebraic structure (for example the class of all monoids), a natural design is to create a type  as a product type which models all the required fields (an element , an operator , proofs that the monoid laws are satisfied etc.). In doing so, we are creating a map .  A possible drawback of this approach is that given a monoid  (a monoid with support type ) and   (a monoid wih support type ), we cannot even write the equality  (let alone prove it) because it is ill-typed. An alternative design would be to create a type  where the support type is just another field , so that given , it is always meaningful to ask whether . Somehow, one would like to argue that if  and  have the same supports () and the operators are equals (, which may be achieved thanks to some extensional equality axiom), and that the proof fields do not matter (because we have some proof irrelevance axiom) etc. , then . Unfortunately, we can't event express the equality  because it is ill-typed... </p>
<p>To simplify the problem, suppose we have:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>I would like to have results of the form:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This statement is ill-typed so we can't have it. </p>
<p>I may have axioms allowing me to prove that two types  and  are same, and I may be able to show that  and  are indeed the same too, but I want to have a tool allowing me to conclude that . Any suggestion is welcome. </p>","<p>A low-tech way to prove this is to insert a manual type-cast, using the provided equality. That is, instead of having an assumption , you have an assumption . Below I explicitly write the cast as a match, but you could also make it look nicer by defining a function to do it.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>There is a nicer way to hide most of this machinery by using ""heterogenous equality"", also known as JMeq. I recommend <a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/html/Equality.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Equality chapter of CPDT</a> for a detailed introduction. Your example becomes</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In general, although this particular theorem can be proved without axioms, if you do the formalization in this style you are likely to encounter goals that can not be proven in Coq without axioms about equality. In particular, injectivity for this kind of dependent records is not provable. The JMEq library will automatically use an axiom  about heterogeneous equality, which makes it quite convenient.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.240628507295174,0.2,0.0,1,1

<p><strong>Number of ads per page</strong></p>
<p>The number of ads on a single screen should not exceed one if the ad is fixed to the screen top or screen bottom. If the page scrolls, only one ad should be visible on screen at a time.</p>

<p>As can be seen, there is no restriction as to the number of ads per , only that at any point of time, a single screen should not have more than one ad.  So, if your fragments get replaced by each other, and at any point of time only one ad is present on the screen, you can have different ads in these fragments. You also have to consider the different layouts that you present (for example, if all the fragments are shown at a time in a single screen in the tablet layout, you need to take care that only one ad is visible).</p>",0.0,0.0,0.021099887766554432,0.0,0.0,0,1

If registration fails, init function fails, thus insmod command will not succeed in loading the kernel module i.e. <strong>test.ko</strong> and device node will not be created.

<pre></pre>
<p>I tried many things to find out what's causing this behaviour but got nothing, I thought it could be that the id and name variables are not null terminated so I manually added \0 at the end and then I thought it could be that the buf is getting overwritten in the loop so I used memset to reset it and also reset all the char arrays and checked the length of everything but I just can't see what's going wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>","<p>As was mentioned in the comments, you're not properly adding the null byte to the end of  and  after calling .</p>
<p>From the man page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strncpy() function is similar, except that not more than n bytes
  of src  are copied. Thus, if there is no null byte among the first n
  bytes of src, the result will not be null-terminated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after using  you need to manually add a null byte as the last byte of the array.  What you're doing instead is using  to find the length of the string.  This function only works if the string is correctly null terminated, which after the  call it might not be.</p>
<p>So instead of this:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This adds the null byte as the last character.</p>
<p>Now to explain the behavior you were seeing:</p>
<p>When you first read in , all 8 bytes of this array were populated with the 8 bytes of the string in question.  It printed correctly because  appears in memory immediately after  (I'll explain how I know this momentarily) and  was initialized to all zeros outside of the loop, so the first byte of  (which contains a null byte) effectively terminates .</p>
<p>Then when you read in , the null terminator for  (which was actually in ) was overwritten.  Then when you later print , it prints the bytes from  but doesn't find the null byte, so it keeps reading the bytes where  lives until it finds the null terminator for that string and prints .  The fact that  printed this was is how we know that  appears immediately after  in memory (in this particular case).</p>
<p>The reason you saw the error with  but not with  is because  wasn't big enough for the string you read in (so null terminator was not added), but  was big enough for its string (so a null terminator was added).</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0022446689113355773,0.0,0.0,1,1

The server-side socket has a , the client-side socket has a .</p>
<p>The intention is to encrypt a plaintext string using RSA via Java's built-in  class, send the resulting ciphertext byte array through the , then read it from the  and decrypt it back into the plaintext.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Problem is, the byte array read from the  does not match the byte array sent to the . I print both to the console then copy-paste them below each other in Notepad for comparison and they do not match; attempting to decrypt the received ciphertext anyway naturally throws an .</p>
<p>Now, I eventually wised up to the fact that  immediately stops the moment it encounters the byte value for the ASCII linefeed and carriage return characters (0A and 0D), regardless of whether there is an actual linebreak or the received data just happens to contain these bytes due to being encrypted. Yet simply repeating  and concatenating the results does not help, since there's no way to know which of the two caused  to stop and thus no way to know which one to insert back into the ciphertext. Other than these missing characters messing up the ciphertext's length, it comes through fine.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was replacing  with a  repeated until the actual, deliberate line termination:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This got the correct length for the ciphertext. Now the problem is that while the whole ciphertext is received, it is full of bit errors.

I'm <em>pretty sure</em> it's caused by the dual type-casting (since  returns an , which won't implicitly convert into ), but would like a second opinion to confirm and point me towards a possible solution. It might be an encoding issue but I'm baffled where that would happen: the ciphertext's s get turned into s, sent through, read out as s, typecasted back into s then typecasted back into s. I mean, if a UTF-16 character gets written onto a buffer then gets read back out as an  by the same environment that wrote it onto the buffer in the first place, won't that  contain the original character's UTF-16 code? Or would typecasting interpret it as ASCII?</p>","<p>Ciphertext from modern cryptographic schemes is binary. If you assume that the binary data can be interpreted as characters with some kind of character encoding (ASCII, UTF-8, etc.), then you'll be disappointed. Not all bytes make up valid printable characters. Some control characters are even interpreted in some special way which breaks the ciphertext.</p>
<p>That is why you don't use String-based ""streams"" ( and  in Java) and use actual streams ( and ) instead.</p>

<p>Here is my code</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Here is my class map</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>I would typically access a CSV file using the CSV as a Stream resource, as such:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>A few lines from a CSV file would typically look like this</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>In this example, there would be a total of 4 games created, 8 teams created and 4 referees. Leicester, Everton, Steve Dunn and Andy Hall would all contain duplicates, which is incorrect, ie three Team objects for Leicester and 2 Referee objects for Andy Hall etc.</p>
<p>The .CSV file that i'm using is in a flat format and has as a row for each game played.  There are columns for the Home team, Away team and referee.  There are other columns, but for the purpose of the question I'm asking, the other details are irrelevant.</p>
<p>When csvHelper reads a game record, it creates 1 new referee and 2 new teams.  After reading 300 games, there are 300 referees (250+ duplicates) and 600 teams (550+ duplicates) in the database.  Ideally, the referee and teams should be looked up from the database first before creating a new one.</p>
<p>Because there are two teams per game, two new team objects are created for each line or game in the CSV file.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure how to make this work using mappings, assistance would be welcome.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>","<p>I've looked at the  library and its internal object construction logic.</p>

You should include a user agent because API's are frequently tweaked to deal with the foibles of various http clients and specifically list the format of the output you want. Adding acceptable encodings lets the API compress data. Charset is a good idea. You could even add a language request but most API's don't care.</p>

<p>Above I am attempting to implement a durable queue using redis.  I need this portion of the logic to be atomic but seeing as redis transactions don't allow intermediate reads and writes I had to resort to lua.  The problem is that the initial 'rpop' line does not work.  I verified in my redis-cli that it returns (nil) and therefore the 'saved_item' variable is never set correctly.  Is there a better approach to accomplish that intermediate read and then conditional logic using that value?</p>","<p>As a newcomer to lua, I had to hack at this till it worked and still haven't figured out why without combing through lua docs.  The key was to create a local function to return the rpop item from that and store it in a local variable rather than try directly.  Something to do with Lua return values.</p>

1190,Splitting music file into chunks,"<p>How would you go about splitting a music file (preferably mp3) into chunks?</p>
<p>I am using the SDL_mixer API. There may be some useful functions in there but I couldn't find any.</p>
<p>The purpose is to use FFT on each chunk to get the frequencies to use in visualization.</p>","<p>I see now that the SDL_mixer library isn't going to give you what you want. Its support for ""music"" (MP3) plays the file externally from the mixer, so apart from volume and position controls that the API provides, you can't insert yourself into its audio stream.</p>
<p>If you were using  objects instead to take advantage of the channel mixer, you would be able to add yourself as an effect on the channel that's streaming the music, using . Another place you could insert yourself is after the mix, using , if you wanted to visualize the final mix of chunks instead of an individual channel or channels. However, those chunks are best suited for short sounds, as they are loaded entirely into memory rather than streamed – and they don't currently support MP3.</p>
<p>If you're committed to using SDL, consider using SDL_sound for this task. This is another extension to SDL, which handles just the decoding of files. It hands you data a chunk at a time when you use . You can then take the decoded data and pass it to the mixer by using  to keep a stream-like approach. Or, you could even load the whole file with , and fill in a  directly, if you want to take advantage of the mixer and effect functions, at the expense of streaming.</p>
<p>Things to watch out for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the audio is decoded in the output format that the mixer expects.</li>
<li>Look out for any case where the decoder can't keep up with the mixer on occasion – in which case you'd need to come up with a separate process for the decoding so that you can stream in ahead of where the mixer is and handle occasional bumps in reading without glitching.</li>
<li>There may be cases where the chunk size you get from the decoder is not the chunk size you want for analysis. You might be able to use  to simplify this problem.</li>

<p>Operating system for both systems is same Win XP SP3.</p>
<p>Any ideas why this is happening?</p>
<p>Edit: The remote system language is Brazil</p>","<p>The simplest answer I can think of is that the icons are installed under another profile instead of for all users.

<p>Another thing to check is to be sure your computer didn't have icons before you installed it.  If you have been using your PC to test the installation, maybe a previous one left the icons there and it is masking the fact that you aren't really installing the icons anywhere.</p>

1198,GUI app spawned from a LocalSystem Service (via CreateProcessAsUser) does not have focus,"<p>I have created a service which display a sort of splash screen on the desktop of a specific user and only when that user is logged in (kiosk user).</p>
<p>That splash screen, once entered a valid code, will tell that to the service and the service goes to sleep for an x amount of time (depending of the code).</p>
<p>The splash screen simply quits. Now when the service wakes up it sees that the splash is no longer there and so start it up.</p>
<p>This all is working, the only problem is that the launched application does not have focus, i.e. if I am working in notepad and the time is up, the splash screen is displayed (full screen though) behind notepad.</p>
<p>I only have to worry about Windows Vista, I am coding in Python using win32 extensions but I believe this problem lies in CreateProcessAsUser when called from the LocalSystem account.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Update:</h3>
<p>The 'problem' is actually an on purpose limitation to prevent 'irritating' applications like mine from stealing focus.</p>
<p>You can change the behaviour by setting:
win32gui.SystemParametersInfo(win32con.SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT, 0, 0)
which is equivalent in temporarily setting the registry value:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\ForegroundLockTimeout
This must be done as the user itself, so either build it in the app you are launching or build an launching helper for the app you want to launch.</p>
<p>However an application might want to prevent getting it's focus stolen by using some API call which I don't remember right now.</p>
<p>A probably good solution would be to find all window handles currently from that user and then use each of these handles to use win32gui.ShowWindow(handle, command) to minimize it.</p>
<p>Although for this particular problem setting the locktimeout setting was enough.</p>
<p>If anyone wonders how I managed to launch an application to a desktop from a service, here is a <a href=""http://blog.dcuktec.com/2009/05/python-on-windows-from-service-launch.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link to the code</a>.</p>","<p>For various very legitimated reasons, Microsoft would rather not see a service launching an app and stealing focus, however I found the following work around to still accomplish what I want.</p>
<p>The original intend is to have a kiosk like application hindered by a pass code like splash screen, which upon entering a 8 character code closes the splash screen for a period time as in the pass code defined. Originally the actual application to use was started by the autostart folder.</p>
<p>However I now rewrote it that it is launched from my service, this way I can hide the application by launching an helper application from the service that just hides the program and launches the splash screen, upon exiting the splash screen the program is returned to the previous state.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.13961840628507297,0.0,0.0,0,0

1234,How is this Hello World-style swf causing a massive memory leak?,"<p>Make a swf out of this, run it through IE, and watch as your memory keeps growing - and possibly even skyrockets - for reasons that appear to be out of the Flash programmer's control:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>This is not isolated to one particular program.  We've been dealing with an issue that started out in much bigger software where, if you have a  object and a  object, supply a local feed to the user, and keep performing redirects back to the same site, there is a serious memory leak.</p>
<p>(It's worse on some machines than on others, but it's there.  We've also seen instances where it would hit a threshhold, go back a little, and then just skyrocket from there without further hindrance.)</p>
<p>We've tried several things, including wrapping the browser in a .NET program and handling the refreshes through .NET, not through Flash.  We've toggled between different things the site would do in different refreshes.  All that stuff.</p>
<p>This is at the very core of what Flash is and what it's intended for, so is there any way (hopefully aside from using debug swfs and Flash Players) to stop such a memory leak, or is Adobe/Microsoft really this sloppy?</p>","<p>It's an IE problem, not a Flash one evidently.  This is true regardless of whether IE is being used normally or through a .NET program with a  object.</p>
<p>That being said, what we were running into with our code involved the usage of a  object in VB.NET, and we were handling the majority of our refreshes and redirects through the .NET code, not in the Flash code.  So if you were to take the refreshes out of the Flash code in the question and then relocate them into the .NET code, this is a short example of something that would not have that memory leak:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The trick is to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Establish DLL imports for 's  and  functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeatedly call , either around the same time as a redirect or on its own seperate timing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>IE / the WebBrowser object in .NET has an internal memory leak, but this solution gets around the problem by telling the OS to step in and get involved.  By passing  for the second and third arguments to , you cause that function to run in a special mode that examines all the pages in memory for the process, and then trim out the ones that are deemed unnecessary.  Usually this probably isn't the best way to solve memory leaks, but since the API class is internally problematic, it's probably a good idea in this case.</p>

1248,"Why would an ADF Business Components Entity Attribute render as ""updatable while new"" when all relevant configurations are set for ""updatable always?""","<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The application in question is a WebCenter 11g in-house development project using ADF Business Components, JSF 2.0, and Facelets, and is being developed using JDeveloper 11g Release 2, version 11.1.2.4.0. The model project contains an Entity Object with many values for reviewing business projects. The view controller project contains a single page within a bounded task flow, which houses an input form referencing these values for creating and editing reviews. ADF Security features are enabled across the application. In the context of these reviews, intended functionality indicates one class of users can only edit certain ""S.E."" values, while other users can edit all values and create new reviews. To facilitate this, Entity Attribute-level security has been implemented for the reviews.</p>
<h1>The Issue</h1>
<p>The review form renders correctly, with the exception of a small, random selection of the values' input elements (eight out of 40) that render as read-only/disabled <em>only</em> when editing an existing record, but have no issue when creating a new record. When testing using the AppModule testing functionality, the same results are observed: the same eight values can be edited by the test user <em>only</em> for new records, while all other values are editable for new and existing records.</p>
<h1>Specifics</h1>
<p>The View Object and Entity Object Attributes for these values are all configured with the <strong>Updatable</strong> property set to <em>Always</em>. These values include some of the aforementioned ""S.E."" values, but not all of them - nor are all of the values at issue included within the ""S.E."" value group. The test user is set as an administrator for the application, an Application Role to which <em>all</em> Resource Entitlements are granted.</p>
<h1>Failed Resolutions</h1>
<p>I've attempted changing the View Object and Entity Object Attributes' <strong>Updatable</strong> attributes to <em>While New</em> and <em>Never</em>, then switching them back to <em>Always</em> - confirming that the changes were made in the XML file with each switch. I've checked and rechecked the ADF Security configuration several times, and confirmed the security for each of those values is <em>identical</em> to that of the other values in the same form/Entity for which the issue does not occur. I've cleaned the application and rebuilt the projects (model and vc) individually before deploying to a freshly launched Integrated WebLogic Server; I've closed and relaunched JDeveloper before rebuilding and redeploying; I've even restarted the computer, as sometimes the nature of my enterprise causes odd issues with JDeveloper that are only resolved by a log out or restart of the entire system. I've also confirmed that the issue occurs on my coworker's machine.</p>
<h1>Ground Rules</h1>
<p>Due to the nature of my environment, I cannot divulge explicit details of the application, and the following suggestions are unacceptable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading JDeveloper</li>
<li>Upgrading Java</li>
<li>Upgrading WebLogic/WebCenter</li>
<li>Upgrading ADF, JSF, or any other library</li>
</ul>","<p>As it turns out, this issue was caused by an ADF Security/JDeveloper SNAFU. The Entity Attributes in question were renamed (refactored) at some point, and for some reason this change propagated to everything ... except the Attributes' permission configuration. The Attributes and all other references to them held the new names, but their Permission elements in the Entity XML file still held the old names. This was not apparent until reviewing the XML directly, as the JDeveloper UI for ADFBC Entities does not reflect the warning state shown in the XML editor. The solution, then, was to either disable and re-enable Attribute-level security for those Attributes or to manually adjust the Permission elements' parameters within the XML.</p>",0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.2473625140291807,0.2,0.0,0,0

SIGHUP is used for reloading my config file, SIGCHLD is used to waitpid with nohang on a process it spawns and the others to terminate the process.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>My current understanding of signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>signal occurs</li>
<li>complete current operation on line 505. ie: open(""t.txt"");</li>
<li>run signal handler code to completion</li>
<li>return to line 505 and continue</li>

<li>signal occurs</li>
<li>break out of current code</li>
<li>run signal handler code to completion</li>
<li>continue from break out code</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Should I enhance my code to block SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGCHLD while reloading the config so that I don't have unstable code if a signal occurs? Or is that over-design? (Assuming it doesn't resume after)</li>
<li>Say I am in the signal handler for a SIGHUP but then a SIGHUP signal occurs, what happens? (I assume it queues them and runs the handler twice)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>","<p>Actually, if a signal occurs, your current operation isn't necessarily going to finish before the signal handler is called. However, upon completion of the signal handler, your code resumes from exactly where it was when the signal interrupted. And since all your signal handler does is set a flag variable, there's no effect on the code that currently in middle of whatever else it's doing.</p>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Why bother? Your code <em>does</em> resume after, and any properly designed signal handler isn't going to destabilize the code.</li>
<li>Documentation seems to indicate that the handling of the second signal will be deferred until the first handler completes. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/10093907/2171689"">this question</a> for details.</li>

<p>use @Input property on child component to pass the validation boolean, and apply the class directly according to the Input passed.</p>

<p>I'm used to working with STL, so I would usually use this code:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Anyway, lets say I create a new ""List"".</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>or even a List of Objects</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So let's say I  20 different integers, so that creates the appropriate # of new nodes.</p>
<p>Now, how can I traverse this list so I can find a sum of all these ints? Is that possible, or does my current functionality prevent that? I would have to implement some sort of iterator to my List Class?</p>
<p>Now I know I could keep an outside variable, every time I do an  call to keep track of my sums. However, I want the code to be compatible with Lists of Objects as well. (I want to be able to search one value in a node, and retrieve another value in the same node eventually)</p>

1374,how to find the maximum size of ostream class in c++,"<p>I am assigning <br/>
where  is </p>
<p>after assigning i am filling  appx 1172528 characters.</p>
<p>But after some extent i am not able to insert charcters inside . I tried surfing on the net whats the maximum size of this class but couldn't find.</p>
<p>Someone please tell how much characters maximum i can store in . Is there any function which can tell me the maximum size of this class??</p>","<p>There are several possible causes for output to an  to fail.
The most obvious is that the underlying supporting media (memory, in the
case of an ) is full.  Another is that you've
reached some internal limit: a lot of systems have (or had) file size
limits which would hit you long before the disk was full, and some
systems have had similar constraints on single objects in memory (and
the  class typically keeps its data in a single object).
(There's also the possiblity of a hardware error, but if this occurs
with , i.e. a memory error, the hardware probably won't 
detect it.)</p>
<p>All of these mean that there is no hard limit as to how much you can
write to a stream, string or otherwise.  It all depends, and one time,
you might succeed writing 2 GB, and the next fail after 1 MB or less.
Practically speaking, in most cases, you should be aware of the fact
that writes can fail, test the results (after a final flush) and be
prepared to do something reasonable if they do.</p>
<p>In the specific case of string streams, of course, about the only
failure you're likely to be able to detect is out of memory.  (An
 does <strong>not</strong> propagate an exception from the ; it
sets the  when one occurs, and if exceptions have been activated
for , it will throw its own exception, not rethrow the original
one.  Which means that an  will not propagate out.)<br/>
A lot of applications don't handle out of memory, and should logically
have set the new handler to abort.  If you've set the new handler to
abort, then you can probably forego such error checking on string
outputs.</p>",0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.05768799102132435,0.0,0.0,1,1

<p>Suppose I wanted to write a trivial factorial function:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>But now, I also want to check if the factorial overflows (without simply hard coding a MAX_FACTORIAL_PARAMETER or something of the like).  In general checking for overflow during multiplication is as simple as checking the result against the original inputs, but in this case, since overflow can occur at any point, it would be rather expensive to perform more divisions and comparisons in every single loop.</p>
<p>The question then, is twofold--is there any way to solve the factorial problem of overflow without checking for multiplication overflow at every step or hard coding a maximum allowed parameter?</p>
<p>And in general, how should I approach problems that involve many stages of iteration/recursion that could silently fail at every stage without compromising performance by introducing expensive checks at each?</p>","<p>While Java does not help you with this, there certainly are languages that help with overflow.

While the only place is use pool.end() is at the end of the apllciation.</p>","<p>It's a rare MySQL server that can handle anything close to 1600 connections.  If you have one of those servers, you know it: you're paying a small fortune for the hardware, and you probably have a team of database administrators looking after it.</p>
<p>There's a bit of a paradox here: more connections to production MySQL servers usually slow things down. Why? When many connections present similar queries to the server, they often contend with each other.  </p>
<p>Vast pools also can conceal application problems like very slow queries and pool-connection leaks. </p>

<p>As a concept I don't see why we cant have a predetermined number of mappers and feed chunks of text files to them. </p>","<p>To optimally balance performance and work load distribution the framework determines the number of mappers by number of input splits.</p>
<p>The Apache hadoop wiki link here<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowManyMapsAndReduces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowManyMapsAndReduces</a> goes in detail -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually controlling the number of maps is subtle. The mapred.map.tasks parameter is just a hint to &gt;the InputFormat for the number of maps. The default InputFormat behavior is to split the total number &gt;of bytes into the right number of fragments. However, in the default case the DFS block size of the &gt;input files is treated as an upper bound for input splits. A lower bound on the split size can be set &gt;via mapred.min.split.size. Thus, if you expect 10TB of input data and have 128MB DFS blocks, you'll &gt;end up with 82k maps, unless your mapred.map.tasks is even larger. Ultimately the InputFormat &gt;determines the number of maps.</p>

1410,Form in Symfony 2 whose fields change in number and purpose according to external data,"<p>I am building an application using Symfony 2, and one of the pages contains a large form, which has a number of fixed fields but also a number of fields whose presence and number depends entirely on related data taken from the DB.  More specifically, the form poses a number of questions, and the questions themselves come from the DB, having different text and IDs.  The answers need to be stored in the DB, linked to the questions.</p>
<p>I've read up on how Symfony handles forms (<a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/forms.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Basic Symfony Forms</a>), including the relationship between a Form object and the data object backing it, creating Fields from the Form object, and validating input according to rules applied to the Form object.</p>
<p>Since I don't want a fixed Form object I looked at how you're meant to dynamically modify Forms (<a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/dynamic_form_modification.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dynamic Symfony Forms</a>), but the examples there seem to be about choosing whether to show certain pre-defined fields, or controlling the options in the fields, not completely generating new fields from scratch, which is what I want.</p>
<p>I had a look at the <a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/data_transformers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Symfony page on Data Transformers</a>, and it seemed relevant, but I couldn't quite get my head around how it would help me.  They seem more about mapping a Form object to an Entity than mapping complex form submissions to a Form object.</p>
<p>I did see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14606635/84649"">this SO answer</a> where the object backing the Form object is just an array, which also seemed relevant: I thought that maybe the answer was to generate some anonymous object with the dynamic fields in, and then make a form from that, but I don't see how I'd set up Symfony validation on it, and my form is not completely different each time, so doesn't need to be entirely anonymous.</p>
<p>What is the best way to achieve this using Symfony 2, ideally without giving up such framework benefits as easy validation etc?</p>
<p>EDIT I hadn't heard of <a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Symfony Form Collections</a> before, and it looks like this might do what I want - each Question in my case would map to an individual subform object.

When I deploy the application to my device the control renders as expected. Is there any way to fix this?</p>
<p>For reference, I'm trying to build a simple toolbar that has a bunch of clickable icons. I'm sure there are other ways of achieving this but I'm using this as a learning as my XAML skills are pretty lacking. My code can be found below.</p>

<p><strong>ResourceDictionary Entry</strong></p>
<pre></pre>","<p>In a nutshell, the problem is that the types of IconData and Path.Data don't match. While IconData is a string, Path.Data wants a Geometry. So if you want to put the path's data in a resource dictionary, its type has to be Geometry or one of its subclasses. Consider, that WPF won't throw an exception when a binding fails. Instead you get a message in the Output-Window of Visual Studio.</p>
<p><strong>But why can I use a string when I set the Path.Data-Property directly?</strong></p>
<p>The Path never really gets a string. When the XAML parser gets a wrong type for a property, it looks at the class of the type it expected. It's searching there for a TypeConversion-Attribute. When the parser looks at Geometry, it finds such an attribute:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The attribute specifies a TypeConverter. For Geometry it is GeomtryConverter, which can convert strings to Geometry. There's an article at msdn about that, if you want to know more: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ayybcxe5.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to: Implement a Type Converter</a></p>
<p><strong>Fine, but how do I use Geomtries in ResourceDictionaries?</strong></p>
<p>The thing becomes clear once you try to create an path without asiging a string to Path.Data. A simple bezier curve before:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>and after:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The TypeConverter produces such an output. Only the points are again converted by a TypeConverter. However, the next step is simple: Just put the PathGeometry in the ResourceDictionary.</p>
<p>As a little side node: You can avoid using ElementName for every binding by setting the user controls DataContext to itself:</p>

In this case your model consists of an  where  is the type of the elements in this collection therefore the display template must be called .</p>

On some condition (an inactivity timeout) I have to lock my swing window (and any subwindows) and after unlocking again through valid credentials, I need to unlock them all back.</p>
<p>I am using glasspane foe that and my two functions are as below</p>
<p>Main lock module</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Sub lock method</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>unlock main method</p>
<p>public void unlock() {

<p>sub unlock method</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Just to repeat again My lock and unlock does happen successfully. Well unlock not successfully, cause after unlock there remains a busy cursor over my unlocked window. Its as good as gone. Useless.</p>
<p>I have seen from logs I am getting successfully out from unlock call. Then I don't know hat is causing that busy cursor to appear and block anything on my window.</p>
<p>I have got those logs too and they are pretty fine</p>
<p>I am not sure what is causing this then? </p>
<p>Possible culprits and things I have tried</p>
<ol>
<li>not doing invalidate in lock unlock</li>
<li>setting glasspane to null explicitly</li>
<li>not doing any listener stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these to no avail, situation remains bleak.</p>
<p>Anybody had experienced same, can give me pointers please? </p>
<p>One constraint I have is I cant leave the glasspane method, to maintain homogeneity between application I have to use that. So I have to get this only working, no alternatives.</p>

1445,Is Navigation to Objects (NOT URIs) with Navigation Framework in Silverlight (with MEF) possible?,"<p>Here is my situation.  I have an app that is composed almost entirely using MEF.  All of the application's UI is downloaded using MEF's <strong><em>DeploymentCatalog</em></strong>.  Navigation was performed simply by swapping out content areas in the main app from downloaded xaps.  Fine.  But I decided it would be nice to provide navigation history on the browser.  So I want to roll in the Navigation Framework (<strong><em>Frame</em></strong> specifically).</p>
<p>Here is the problem, I can't seem to use the Frame because it requires you to pass a URI.  Because my assemblies are downloaded and stored in the <strong><em>CompositionContainer</em></strong>, the normal format of the URI for assembly reference doesn't work (i.e. <strong><em>/{assembly};component/{XAML Path}</em></strong> doesn't work)</p>
<p>In just .NET (not silverlight) you can navigate to an object on the Frame by passing the content.  This is what I would like to do in silverlight but the method doesnt' appear.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could support navigation without using a URI?  And without restructuring the entire application (i.e. I know the navigation framework now supports the <strong><em>NavigationContentLoader</em></strong> but this would require me to restructure my application and doesn't allow me to easily manage other classes that get composed through MEF that don't have UI components)</p>

<p>To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system, the symbol H (for “hash”) should be used wherever possible.

<p>The H symbol can be used with a range. For example, H H(0-7) * * * means some time between 12:00 AM (midnight) to 7:59 AM. You can also use step intervals with H, with or without ranges.</p>
<p>The H symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range, but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that the value remains stable for any given project</p>

1486,Removing channel(s) from a user while deleting,"<p>I've found myself in a situation where I have users that subscribe to various things to receive notifications. That all works great when it's the user himself subscribing and unsubscribing from the channels. I run into an issue when I want to delete a user and restrict him access to one of those channels. I'm writing my app for iOS and have realized that editing another devices PFInstallation is a no go. What really needs to happen is when an admin decides to delete a user from his group of notifications, some code is run before the deletion to ensure this user will no longer receive notifications for that group.</p>
<p>It's broken down like this:
There are different departments (fire departments). Each has a certain number of types of notifications (ex. fire, ems, chief, all)... So the user can enable / disable channels for each of these (the channel is a combination of the notification type and the objectid of the dept; ex: fire_abc123). The user will most likely have multiple departments so simply deleting the installation or clearing the channel array wouldn't be the best option. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's really no code I can post because I haven't figured out how to quite do this yet.</p>","<p>I would suggest using cloud code to accomplish this. If you cannot edit other devices installations in your code, you can  in a cloud code function to modify them. The function would find the installation that the user you want to remove is linked to, and remove a certain channel from that installation.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1

<p>I have a page in an online store that lets the user pick a date for a tour.  That page has a ConLib which contains a couple of panels.  The first is:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>and then another asp:Panel with other stuff - calendar, buttons, etc.  The SortedGridView is supplied by our shopping cart provider and is basically a regular asp:Grid.  </p>
<p>When the user says they want 3 tickets I do a </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>to keep them from changing it after picking a date/time.  At various points they can click a reset button that will do many things but one task is to set the value to zero in the gridrow text boxes and enable the Grid since they reset the process and want to pick new things.</p>
<p>I have stepped through the code with breakpoints in place and it seems that the problem I am having is that my reset button click event handler fires after the Grid is rendered with the disabled status in the Page Render stage of life.  If that is true then setting the Grid in code behind will never show the enabled grid on the page without a refresh since it's already rendered.  If I refresh the page manually it does indeed show as enabled so I think I'm on the right problem.</p>
<p>My question is twofold, if there is enough info here to answer it:<br/>
1. Is it likely that what I think I am seeing is true - the page renders the control disabled and then the button handler tries to enable it but it's too late at that point since the control is already rendered?<br/>
2. How can I work around this?  I would prefer to avoid JQuery if at all possible... it has some unintended side effects with the way our original store software is written.</p>
<p>Further info:<br/>
I have a status flag _EventSelected which tells if the calendar event has been selected.  On the reset button click I set that to false and on PreRender I check that to see if it is false and enable the Grid.  Again, the status doesn't change until the Reset Button Click event handler and that is <em>after</em> the PreRender.  </p>

<p>Now we ofcourse want to check if the querystring parameter p doesnt contain errors.
I now have this setup:</p>
<p>1) Check if p exists</p>
<p>2) Filter out html from p's value</p>
<p>3) htmlencode p's value</p>
<p>4) check if p is integer</p>
<p>5) check if p's integer exists in db</p>
<p>This is how I usual do it, though step 5 is ofcourse a performance hit.</p>
<p>Kind regards,
Mark</p>","<p>Quite simple. For most data types (integers, decimals, doubles, dates and booleans) there is a very strict format. If the value does not parse under the strict format, it's an error.</p>
<p>Strings <strong>sometimes</strong> have a strict format, like an email address or a phone number. Those can be validated with a simple regexp. If it conforms, use it, otherwise it's an error.</p>
<p>Most of the time however strings will simply need to be persisted to the DB and later displayed again. In that case no processing is needed, aside from escaping when inserting into DB (unnecessary as well if you used parametrized queries)k, and HTML-encoding when rendering to the display.</p>
<p>This way any and all data is validated, and there is no risk of any injections whatsoever.</p>
<p>The rare exception of a loose format for a string is, well... rare. I can't think of any right now. For that you can afford some more extensive parsing and processing.</p>
<p><strong>Added:</strong> Oh, yes, checking whether IDs (or other values) are valid in respect to a DB. You're doing it right, but think if you always need it. Quite often you can put the check into some other query that you have to do anyway. Like when you select data based on the ID, you don't need to explicitly check that it exists - just be ready that your query can return no data.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't need to use the value at all, then you can simply ignore it.</p>
<p>But, of course, there are other times, like when inserting/updating data, that you indeed need to explicitly check whether the data exists and is valid in the current context.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

<p>I have read that you can get most of what you need about an EDI format by looking at the last 3 characters of the ISA line.  This is fine if every EDI used line breaks to separate entities, but I have found that many are single line files with any number of characters used as breaks.  I have noticed that the VERY last character in every EDI I've parsed is the break character.  I've looked at a few hundred, and have found no exceptions to this.  If I first grab that character, and use that to obtain the last 3 of the ISA line, should I reasonably expect that I will be able to parse data from an EDI?</p>

What I meant by pre-era is not the time before AJAX/jQuery was created, but rather the time before it is popularized and widely adopted (by a significantly large number of programmers).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your time and expertise.</p>","<p>I have always been an opponent of the RegisterClientScriptBlock methods and object structure. When you use these methods, your JavaScript is injected into the page at the behest of the page controls. This means it could end up being output in very specific positions and not necessarily in the order desired.</p>
<p>My JavaScript methods are always external to the page, typically in a separate file. When needed I use a literal control to output JavaScript assignment objects (to let the scripts know what any pertinent ClientIDs might be for accessing fields. </p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

<p>Where do I put the code, do I have to use 2 different UILabel or maybe CoreAnimation ? When do I change the date ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance !</p>","<ol>
<li>In your  delegate method, check if the scroll view's  indicates that the user has scrolled to another page.</li>
<li>If so, change the label's text to the new date. It won't animate yet, but do this before you try the animation.</li>
<li><p>For the animation, add a  to the label's layer and configure it to your liking:</p>
<pre></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>This effect is a little different from the fading of the Springboard icons (since those fade  continuously as you scroll further to the Spotlight page) but I think my approach is more appropriate for your application. To emulate the Springboard effect, you should indeed use two separate labels (with the same frame) and change their opacity values as the scroll view's contentOffset changes.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1
1516,Merging cross referenced XML-files,"<p>I'm co-developing a vehicle information system that reads and presents data from a communication bus. Signaling information on the bus is stored on some kind of database (from the dark ages i'd guess) from which it's only possible to get data out of by extracting a xml-snapshot. Since that wasn't bad enough, someone in upper management thought it was a great idea to treat different parts of the system as different projects (it looked really nice in the organizational chart) which lead to more databases...</p>
<p>It is now my responsibility to merge these xml-files into one and before I start banging my head against the wall i thought it would be a good idea to check with you geniuses if there's any neat solution to my problem.</p>
<p>The structure of the xml is somewhat like this:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>All entities (signals, frames etc.) lies directly under the root element and there can be  several of each. The ID is generated when the file is extracted from the database and changes everytime. The only purpose of the id is to link different entities together, ""Signal 1"" belongs to ""Frame 1"" and so on...</p>
<p>The unique identifier of an entity differ between the entities but it's often an id, name or combination of some elements.</p>
<p>Since there is an overlap between the projects the second xml-file can look like this:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>As you can see there is now multiple instances of ""Frame 1"" and ""Signal 1"" but the second file adds another signal to ""Frame 1"". </p>
<p>What i'm trying to achieve is to add ""Signal 2"" to the first file and update the frame reference to 1001.</p>
<p>The best solution i've come up with so far is to do a plain merge (using linq), search the whole file for duplicates, store all related ID's and last but not least replace the deleted ID's with the correct ones.</p>

1522,Custom Binding in ASP.NET MVC - Changing the Binding Behavior on a Single Field,"<p>I have a double-precision floating point field in my database that stores seconds past midnight.  I have code in c# that can convert this number to the form HH:MM:SS.ffffff, where f is fractions of a second.  I also have code that can parse this back into a double.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is modify the stock binder object in ASP.NET MVC so that it uses MY parsing and ToString() methods instead of the ones it would normally use from the double type, without having to write a complete custom binder.  </p>
<p>Can I write a couple of extension methods in c#, or use a couple of well-placed attributes to let the binder object know about my parsing and ToString() methods?</p>
<p>Here is some more clarification.</p>
<p>if I provide a model such as a Linq to SQL class to the view, MVC can automatically wire up my fields to the underlying data model, provided I use the same names for the controls in my view as I have used in my data model.  If I post my MVC view back to a controller method, I can write the user's changes back to the database by calling the UpdateModel method on my Controller class.  I don't have to worry about wiring up my specific fields from the FormCollection to my Linq to SQL data class, because the binder has done that for me already.</p>
<p>I assume that, in order for the binder to work this magic on an ordinary numeric double, that it must first parse the input from the user (probably by calling double.parse), and pass this to the Linq to SQL class so that it can update the database.  </p>
<p>I need to use my own custom parser, instead of the one that comes with the double data type, for one of the fields in my model.

1567,.NET Application - search problem,"<p>I've got an ASP.NET web app and a  on the server (in the Application[] store). Class Product has a Name property. I need to give users the ability to search for products based on names. For example if the user types 'honda computer', the app has to show '2001 Honda Passport Engine Computer (OEM)'. The search has to be very fast, in future I'll add autocomplete functionality (AJAX).</p>
<p>So far I had a couple ideas how to solve this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write or use an open source implementation of something like B-Tree, Trie, Suffix tree, Prefix tree. Unfortunately data structures and algorithms are not my strongest skill (damn Harvard, so much money for nothing).</p></li>
<li><p>Use a search engine - Lucene.NET, Velocity or MemCached.NET. Never used one, so I don't know if they will work in this scenario. I don't need to search for synonyms and my app doesn't have permissions to access the file system (so no index file).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any advice is welcome.</p>","<p>Depending upon how much data you have, using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree"" rel=""nofollow"">suffix tree</a> would actually be an extremely good idea. Generally users are going to type from the beginning of a phrase when a text-box has auto-suggest enabled and since you can search the tree on the basis of the characters that are being input by the user input as it, a suffix tree would automatically filter down the possible suggestions and also provide you with the suggestions to display by navigating the tree.</p>
<p>While it is true that they can be complicated to implement, you might be able to find one written for .NET already. However, because they tend to be very useful, you can find some good materials <a href=""http://marknelson.us/1996/08/01/suffix-trees/"" rel=""nofollow"">with information on how to write your own</a>.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0

<p>No, you didn't.  Your option  requires an argument, but in your non-working case you try to insert a different option between the  and its argument.  That is not allowed -- if an option takes an argument, whether optional or required, that argument (if provided) must immediately follow the option letter.  The example you linked does not show differently.</p>
<p>What you are trying to do not only is not supported by , it does not follow standard Unix convention.  Moreover, although it could conceivably work the way you imagine for options with <em>required</em> arguments, it is wholly unworkable for options with <em>optional</em> arguments.  When arguments are optional, there is no way to correctly match them with their options if they are not required to follow directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's also a bonus question: how come calling the program with no parameters doesn't abort()?</p>

<p>Why would it?  If no options are specified to the program on its command line then  returns -1 on the first call, and the loop body is never executed.  To get an  from your code, you would need to specify an option that is in the option string, but for which you do not provide a specific case, or else an option that requires an argument, but without providing the argument (in which event  returns , for which you do not provide a specific case).

<p>I think you are using the range method in the wrong way. The Groovy Range construct for the for loop, allows you to loop from one value to another value. This is generally a integer or a string, and not a List.</p>
<p>So, if you do the following, it will print 0 to 10</p>

1583,Customising iPhone App Interface,"<p>I am building a basic app interface which will have a mixture of text, inputfields and buttons. In order to get a working version for project deadline, I thought I would use the default Interface Builder (IB) components for the first iterations and then if there is suffiecient time, I would like to 'jazz up' the interface by adding customised components..</p>
<p>How easy is it to swap over IB components with customised ones at a later stage?</p>","<p>It depends on what you mean exactly by swap over IB components, but in general I would say that IB has full support for customization of your UI within its own conceptual framework. On the other hand, it is pretty obvious that defining your UI programmatically will give you all the customization possibilities you might think of.</p>
<p>In a sense, you can see IB as a way to declare graphically the elements of your UI, their relationships, and have them automatically instantiated for you when the IB xib file is loaded. This is a very flexible mechanism in itself and allows you plenty of possibilities.</p>
<p>Say, for example, that you have a button somewhere in your IB view. In a first release, you could set the class of that button to a plain ; later, you simply specify that that button class is actually a  and you have it, your UI will use your custom button without you having to change much of code (maybe one line or two apart from the custom button implementation). The same holds true for many other kinds of UI elements.</p>
<p>Besides that case, there are classes, like , that I think are better customizable outside of IB (i.e., by specifying the customization, e.g., the custom cell, programmatically). But still in this case, having the interface defined in IB in the first place is not a big hindrance either, and you simply add the code that you need to your program.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are some customization that are not easily possible with IB. One example could be having more control on how and when your UI components are allocated; so, say, you are restricted to your xib file to be instantiated all at once, while programmatically you could trick every aspect of that. Or, there might be UI elements that are intrisically better suited for a programmatically definition (say, a scrollable grid of pictures), so IB would not fit the bill, or give little support for that (but you would not be able to define that UI elements with it in the first place).</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,1

1587,Injecting a specific model implementation on the fly [Robotlegs],"<p>Is model injection on the fly possible? In other words, if I ask for a model of the type IPhotoModel, I should get one of its implementations based on the current state of the view. If I am looking at a UserPage, I should get a user-specific implementation of that model. If I am looking at a LocationPage, I should get a location-specific implementation.</p>
<p>Currently, the only way that I see is introducing a command that specifies the model mapping, with a concrete one based on the current view state ...</p>
<p>something like...</p>
<p>injector.mapValue(IPhotoViewModel, injector.getInstance(UserPhotoViewModel)) or
injector.mapValue(IPhotoViewModel, injector.getInstance(LocationPhotoViewModel))</p>
<p>is this the best way possible? I do not really want to introduce much coupling logic outside of the context, but ...</p>","<p>That's how I do it, and I believe that this is the recommended way.  In fact, I think that many advanced RobotLegs users will break out most of the mappings into Commands for convenience, reuse, and to make it easier to read the program--even if the Command is only run once at startup.  I've used it for things like swapping out mock services for real services--the Command that maps the dependencies is different, but everything else is the same.</p>
<p>I don't see this as ""that much"" coupling logic.  The Command is merely setting up the program based on current Application state.  There's not really that much difference between using a Command to change Injector state vs your own custom Model state.</p>
<p>You may even find that you can reuse your injection mapping Commands across Applications, whereas you might not be able to reuse the entire Context.</p>

<p>That's fine. The variable  holds <em>references</em> to objects, not the objects themselves. When you make a new variable , it holds a second reference to the same object. Then you clear , which means you can't refer to the actual object through  anymore. But that doesn't change the fact that you still have , and you can still refer to the actual object through . (And <em>that</em> in turn implies that the object itself still exists. C# is a garbage-collected language, which, to a first approximation means that objects are guaranteed to stick around until you're done with them. Non-managed C++ is different in this respect, and Objective-C is different in yet a third way. Not that you asked.)</p>

<pre></pre>
<p>If anybody have advice for me, I'll be very grateful!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>","<p>The bottleneck lies, most likely, in the amount of state changes () and the amount of draw calls you are making (). In general, you should draw as much as possible in a single draw call.</p>
<p>The simplest approach wold be to use a ""texture atlas"":</p>
<ol>
<li>combine all your tile textures into a single large texture (this is the ""texture atlas"")</li>
<li>combine all your tile vertices into a single vertex array</li>
<li>call  once to bind the texture atlas</li>
<li>call  once to render all tiles</li>
</ol>
<p>So how do you render different tile textures? Simple: you change the vertex texture coordinates to point to the correct tile inside the texture atlas.</p>
<p>A single 1024x1024 can hold 256 distinct 64x64 tiles. Depending on the amount of distinct tiles in your game, you might have to use multiple texture atlases. Moreover, depending on the size of your map, you might wish to split it into ""regions"" with separate vertex arrays for each (you don't want to render 1 million tiles every frame if your monitor can only display 1000 tiles.)</p>
<p>On its own, this will give a measurable performance boost. Once this is working, you can get a second large boost by storing your vertex arrays on the GPU via Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs).</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1

I am at a point where I can no longer delete all scenes and start over, nor I can extend the segue approach because its quite overused.</p>
<p>I am looking up for small, elegant solution that will allow all my view controllers to have backward navigation. See my scene hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 1---&gt; Page 2</li>
<li>Page 1---&gt; Page 3 ---&gt; Page 4</li>
<li>Page 3---&gt; Page 5 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I should be able to go back from Page 5 to Page 1 backwards.
I have about 12 screens as of now.</p>
<p>What should I do?
Can I safely mess up with storyboard?
Or should I add code snippets to my viewDidLoads and so on to handle the stuff?</p>
<p>My problem is that when I searched the solution, I found too many approaches including navigation controllers, uinavigationbar, UIBarButtonItem and so on. With each of them, I find it maybe too much for my need, and I need a smaller thing that may just work.</p>
<p>All I may need is only back buttons as of now, but with minimal effort - as I am quite tight on deadline :-(</p>
<p>Appreciate quick help.</p>","<p>I found the answer from apple docs - basically I needed an approach to handle things (instead of straight code), and here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialize navcontroller in appdelegate didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method, with root view controller set to first view controller of the app</li>
<li>set appdelegate window's rootviewcontroller = navcontroller </li>
<li>with every 'forward' navigation - use pushViewController along with target view controller</li>
<li>there is no need to handle backward navigation - navcontroller takes care of it by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above will also add extra navigation bar on top of every view controller (except the root view controller of the app's delegate).</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

Thanks in advance....</p>","<p>I won't write the ready code not to encourage spoon-feeding but can show you the way. First thing to do is defining page variable and set it to a default number (1 for the first page for example). Then, you should find out how many pages there are by counting the records and dividing it to the number of posts you want to show on each page. By having the page count variable, now you should be able to display page number links on the page. Each page link should go to same original page, with a get variable like /example.php?page=2</p>
<p>The next step is to call only the related records from database. Lets say page is 4 and you show 10 records on each page. For this case, you should pass first 30 records and call only 10 records. You can do this easily with limit and offset.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0

Its game about scrolling down some shapes, each shape is made up of some square blocks.I have 7 kind of blocks. All loaded in a Sprite Sheet and using these blocks from this sprite sheet I create a shape.

<p>My observations:-</p>
<p>1&gt; I used Time profiler it shows maximum time is in draw()  calls. Also if I play game very fast the peak of time increases  in track, that should be fine as I am giving more work to do, but once a peak is attained it remains approximately at that height only, even if I leave the game Idle. Is it normal ? According to me it should have returned to its normal peak once the current work is done.</p>
<p>2&gt; Some where I thought its happening because I used two batch nodes and removing its children on a user touch immediately might causing it slow but then after removing the children it should run normal. to give an idea is it ok to remove 10 children from batch node immediately ? some guys say its very slow process. Just to check if this causing problem , I did :-</p>
<p>Instead of removing them I just set visibility of the children to false.But still FPS drops and never recovers.</p>

1674,Utilizing UI abstraction,"<p>When utilizing a UI abstraction, then the data you're displaying is protected from implementation changes in the UI layer. Does/should/can this extend to higher-level things, like for example, display as a tree or a grid? I can't work out how to insulate the abstraction from the higher-level details of how the UI is going to display the data garnered through said abstraction.</p>","<p>You want to start with the Model-View-Controller architecture.  This allows you to insulate, as much as possible, your user interface from data changes.  The Model layer is your data objects.  The View layer is your actual Swing components.  The Controller layer is your listeners.  The Model layer is written independently of the other two, with no knowledge of the classes.  The View layer is written with no knowledge of the Controller layer.</p>
<p>If you require more abstraction than that, you can create interfaces for your Model layer so that several different data models can all use the same interface.  This way, it doesn't matter what data you give to the View layer, it just displays it through the use of the interface.</p>
<p>Also realize that it's not always possible to do what you're asking.  Sometimes a user interface needs to be written specifically for the data being displayed.  A tree isn't always a tree, and a grid isn't always a grid.  It works well to customize the View layer to match the data being displayed.  This way, you can tailor the functionality specifically to the data being manipulated and create a better interface for your users.</p>
<p>Certainly, though, it should be done where it makes sense.  This is where experience and judgment play a big factor.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

1677,Can't correctly rotate cylinder in openGL to desired position,"<p>I've got a little objective-c utility program that renders a convex hull.  (This is to troubleshoot a bug in another program that calculates the convex hull in preparation for spatial statistical analysis).  I'm trying to render a set of triangles, each with an outward-pointing vector.  I can get the triangles without problems, but the vectors are driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I'd like the vectors to be simple cylinders.  The problem is that I can't just declare coordinates for where the top and bottom of the cylinders belong in 3D (e.g., like I can for the triangles).  I have to make them and then rotate and translate them from their default position along the z-axis.  I've read a ton about Euler angles, and angle-axis rotations, and quaternions, most of which is relevant, but not directed at what I need:  most people have a set of objects and then need to rotate the object in response to some input.  I need to place the object correctly in the 3D ""scene"".</p>
<p>I'm using the <a href=""http://c3dt.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cocoa3DTutorial</a> classes to help me out, and they work great as far as I can tell, but the rotation bit is killing me.  </p>
<p>Here is my current effort.  It gives me cylinders that are located correctly, but all point along the z-axis (as in this image:<img alt=""alt text"" src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTPGI.png""/>.  We are looking in the -z direction.  The triangle poking out behind is not part of the hull; for testing/debugging.  The orthogonal cylinders are coordinate axes, more or less, and the spheres are to make sure the axes are located correctly, since I have to use rotation to place those cylinders correctly.  And BTW, when I use that algorithm, the out-vectors fail as well, although in a different way, coming out normal to the planes, but all pointing in +z instead of some in -z)</p>

<p>Storing the settings for widget in a file or storing the settings for it in a db.</p>

<p>The settings in the file will be stored as vars and saved as a php file.</p>
<p>The settings in the database will be stored as serilized and then retrieved. But after one retrieval they will be cached for about 5 minutes in a php file as an array. So basically the database class will cache the results and then this would be used. What do you suggest is better to be used.</p>

Another issue was that if I was to check which widgets are owned to the a member on a file system with file names linke memberid_filename, how would i do it?</p>","<p>A database is definitely the right choice if you're going to have multiple copies of the settings (if, say, each user on your site can customize it.)</p>

<p>Now, even though it's established that ""/api/news/0"" <em>and</em> ""/api/news/1"" will be invoked, imagine this <em>unlikely, but theoretically possible</em> situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>articles  exist in database</li>
<li>browser sends both AJAX requests -- asynchronously <em>or</em> synchronously, it doesn't matter!</li>
<li>an article is added to the database sometime <em>between</em> when
<ul>
<li>the <em>server</em> processes the  request, and</li>
<li>the <em>server</em> processes the  request</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, this happens:</p>
<ul>
<li> returns article  (articles  in database)</li>
<li>article  added</li>
<li> returns article  (articles  in database)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that article  was returned <em>twice</em>! Oops :)</p>
<p>So, while the race-condition <em>""seems fairly unlikely""</em>, it does exist. A similar race condition (with different results) can occur if  is processed before  and (once again) an article is added <em>between</em> the requests: <em>there no atomic guarantee</em> in either case!</p>
<p>(The above race condition would be <em>more likely</em> if executing the AJAX requests in-series as the time for a new article being added is increased.)</p>
<h3>Possible Solution</h3>
<p>Consider fetching say,  (2 is okay!) articles in a <em>single</em> request (e.g. ""/api/latest/n""), and then laying out the articles as appropriate <em>in the callback</em>. For instance, the first half of the articles on the left and the second half on right, or whatever is appropriate.</p>
<p>As well as eliminating the particular race-condition above by making the single request an atomic action -- with respect to article additions -- it will also result in less network traffic and less work for the server.</p>
<p>The fetch for the API might then look like:</p>

They could be instantiated near the end or the beginning, it doesn't matter. As soon as the function body is entered, I get a stack overflow.

1698,"When audio is complete, accessing navigationController yields EXC_BAD_ACCESS","<p>The origin of this question stems from the answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8442052/best-practice-for-displaying-multiple-views-in-ios"">this question</a>.</p>
<p>I have a series of puzzles that are managed by their own ViewControllers. The workflow looks like this:</p>
<p>UINavigationViewController--&gt;Menu View Controller--&gt; Routing View Controller --&gt; Randomly Selected Puzzle View Controller</p>
<p>The ""Routing View Controller"" randomly selects a puzzle view controller to push onto the stack. Once someone has solved the puzzle I play a ""You Win"" audio sample and then pop the view controller off the stack. At that point Routing View Controller randomly selects the next puzzle. Here's my code for playing the sound and for popping the puzzle view controller off the stack:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The problem is after the second puzzle is solved I get a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error thrown on this line of code within soundFinishedPlaying:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>If I debug this line of code I can see that clientData has a reference to a UINavigationController so I'm a bit perplexed as to why I'm seeing this error. </p>
<p>I suspect it might have something to do with the fact I need to specify a straight C function for soundFinishedPlaying and/or the fact I need to pass in the UIViewController reference as a void *. </p>
<p>Please let me know where I've gone wrong or if there's a better way to trigger a view transition once an audio clip has completed playing. Thanks in advance!</p>","<p>I figured out what's going on here. The problem was with the ""bridge"" casting I did on this line:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>If I changed the bridge mode to __bridge_retained instead that insured that my instance of NavigationController would not be dereferenced until after the sound completion method had completed. By using __bridge_retained that also means I have to explicitly dereference the point using CFRelease(...) in soundFinishedPlaying.</p>

<pre></pre>
<p>This works very well, at least by my expectations. The cursor processes 8000 rows in about 19 seconds. The 8000 rows are specified by user input, which feeds to the @GuessListSize parameter. However, the parsed data is not always processed correctly, which is to be expected. Hence, the try-catch code. We don't really need the cursor to do anything with the failed stored procedure executions. We started tracking them in a separate table so we can figure out how to better process these data points in the future.</p>
<p>The issue with this is that the cursor now will not return a full list. We are hoping for a list of a size specified by the user. So the cursor pulls the list of the specified size, as it should, but some of those entries may not be properly processed by the stored procedures, returning a list less than the specified size.</p>
<p>So the next thing I tried was a WHILE loop. Now, the WHILE loop worked fine. It returned all of the rows the user requested. However, it took nearly 30 minutes to run through the same size of data set. This is obviously unacceptable.</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Because the Cursor is designed to chew through a pre-defined list of data, I'm not sure how to make said cursor ""dynamic"" and return the user-specified number of results regardless of errors. The WHILE loop has the ""counter"" only increase if the SP executes without hitting the CATCH block, but I don't know how to integrate that into the Cursor, or if I even can.</p>
<p>Is there something obvious I'm missing here?</p>
<p>(As requested, the INSERT SQL SPs)</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Per RBarryYoung's suggestion, I opted to look at the actual SP inserting process a bit. One of the problems I found was that many of our Execs were not pulling a domain to concatenate into an email address. Expanding the areas where the script could look for domain information has improved the process to near-user-specified completion. While it's still not perfect, it's a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>As for finding ways to dynamically force a cursor to pull a specific number of rows, I'm thinking I might nest this particular SP in a second SP that uses the WHILE loop. So basically, while the list size is less than the user-specified list size, it will re-execute the insertion SP. That might work. If it works, I'll re-edit and post this as the solution.</p>","<p>As suggested in the last paragraph of the post, I ended up using nested SPs. The outermost SP runs a WHILE loop that keeps track of however many execs were requested. It then runs the generation SP with the specified number of execs. If the returned number is less than the requested number, it remains in the WHILE loop.</p>

<p>Can you help me understand the two questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What exactly is ""bundled jQuery"" (My first understanding is that it's just some javascript code using jQuery framework. I'm not sure whether I'm right or not)</p></li>
<li><p>What is the author's purpose when he writes ""relies on version specific functionality"", does he mean to force Yii application to use only one version of jQuery and not upgrade to the most latest if it becomes obsolete?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Many thanks!</p>","<p>1) Yii comes with a default jQuery version bundled with it, this is the bundled jQuery he means, the actual ""version"" of jQuery (1.2, 1.3... 1.7, 1.8 etc), not just some code using it. So when you call jQuery in your default Yii install Yii will initiate the jQuery version that's bundled with it, which may not necessarily be the most recent jQuery version, depending on what version of Yii you have and what version of jQuery was bundled with that Yii version.</p>
<p>2) If, for example, the version of Yii you have came bundled with jQuery version 1.7 and you have some code that relies on a feature of jQuery that's only in jQuery version 1.8, then you'd need to suppress the default bundled version (1.7) and use a version you specify (1.8 in this example).</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

1742,Missing PIE linear-gradient behavior in IE8 (but working in IE7 and IE9),"<p>I am using CSS3 properties to style my navigation. I am using background-image: linear-gradient which works in all modern browsers, but lack of support in IE7-8. I am relying on PIE (v1, <a href=""http://css3pie.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://css3pie.com</a>) for implementation across older IE 7 and 8. I tried PIE 2 beta, but it was not working for me.</p>
<p>The problem is the rest of PIE CSS3 properties are working in all browsers everywhere on the site, except this one element, in one browser (IE8).</p>
<p>A class of ""last"" is applied to the last top-level  element in the container . This happens in JavaScript in  and in the CSS li.last has a green gradient background. I tried moving the JS outside of document.ready() so it fires right away, and also tried placing it in  so it fires after TypeKit, neither having an effect on the outcome. </p>
<p>The  property for this element works as expected in IE9. It even works as expected in IE7. But in IE8, nada. All other elements in the page that rely on PIE for linear-gradient and for other CSS3 properties, all load fine.</p>
<p>But for this particular element, the linear-gradient background image is not applied for some reason. I was thinking this is because PIE behavior is run before my JavaScript can apply the last class, because when I inspect I do see the rest of the properties (font-size, color, float) have all been applied. It is not a problem of class inheritance, because other  elements are not styled with any background properties.</p>

Then the defender sends the damage receive back to the attacker so both Players know what has happened.</p>

<p>The secuence is: create a element, compile and add/replace the element in the DOM. Debuging angular.js I can see that NgModelDirective is who comunicate with FormDirective controller to set the $pristine, $touch, ... NgModelDirective has a '^?form' as require to comunicate with parent form.
Well, when I compile the element the template has no parent form due to that is not included in the DOM. ngModel can't find the ancestor form and can't set $error, $pristine, $touch, ...</p>

1779,ios 7 tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath shows blank data on first selection,"<p>I have some apps designed for iOS 6 and today I went to upgrade them to iOS 7.</p>
<p>They are a simple table view lists and when a record is selected it displays details about that row on another screen. This worked flawlessly in iOS 6. With iOS 7 when I select a row it shows a <strong>blank data page</strong> on the <strong>first</strong> selection. If I then go back to the list and reselect the item it then displays the proper data.. <strong>After this first blank display it will work fine for any other records</strong>.. </p>
<p>I am racking my brain and can not for the life of me figure out why this is happening.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>CODE:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Also, the part that changes the button title <strong>Add to Favorites</strong> etc, does not change on the first item selection, it simply shows ""Item"".</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>So I narrowed it down to this piece of code:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>If I remove the if clause then it happens on every selection. If I comment out the whole code I cant make any selections. So I imaging I have to find another way to initialize my view controller. Any ideas? Why did this work in iOS 6 then? </p>","<p>NEW ANSWER: (9/25/13)</p>

<p>All I had to do was surround the commands that were used to set the values on the view in question within a asynchronous tag and viola! Everything worked..</p>

<p>OLD ANSWER: (9/24/13)</p>
<p>Well, I got it to work. It is a total backwards hack but I'm results driven so I don't care. It does kind of upset me that this functionality has changed and needed this hack but whatever.. I hope this helps others who I am sure may be running into this.</p>
<p>I left the above code alone and in the </p>

<p>section I added the following code:</p>

<li><p>I convert this PS file to PDF again, converting it to grayscale with ghostscript:</p>
<p>gs -o output.pdf -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dColorConversionStrategy=/Gray -dProcessColorModel=/DeviceGray input.ps</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This command generates a PDF file. </p>
<p>When I open this last file, I see that all the pages are in grayscale. The command to test color pages says that are in grayscale, too:</p>

<p>For each page, it returned me CMYK values:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>and so on... CMYK: 0,0,0,[something] -&gt; each page is in grayscale.</p>
<p><strong>But when I go to print the document, the printer recognizes each page as sRGB and count them as color pages, not as grayscale pages.</strong></p>
<p>If i check each page with this script, it returns me that all the pages are sRGB, too:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>So the question is: how can I do to make the printer (rather than the script) recognize the pages as grayscale? Is there a method through linux command line that allows me to do it?</p>

<p>The problem was not related to the conversion by GhostScript, but to the software used to open the PDF file.</p>
<p>With the Chrome embedded PDF reader I had this problem, while with the original Adobe Reader plugin (overridden on chrome through chrome extensions) I was able to print correctly in greyscale and to let the printer recognize the format.</p>

How can I switch the profiler to another web-server?</p>","<p>You don't associate the server to be used with the Profiler; you associate the server to be used with the web application you want to profile. To do that:</p>
<p>Step 1 of 3: Create the server:</p>

<li>Create the server that you want to use (i.e. Tomcat, Glassfish, Payara etc.) in NetBeans.</li>
<li>Verify that you can <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>Stop</strong> it from under the <strong>Servers</strong> entry in the <strong>Services</strong> panel.</li>

I cannot afford adding such a hardware requirement for my software.</p>

1910,How to only remove stopwords when they are not nouns?,"<p>I'm using Solr 5 and need to remove stop words to prevent over-matching and avoid bloating the index with high IDF terms. However, the corpus includes a lot part numbers and name initials like ""Steve A"" and ""123-OR-A"". In those cases, I don't want ""A"" and ""OR"" to get removed by the stopword filter factory as they need to be searchable.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/"" rel=""nofollow"">Stanford POS tagger</a> does a great job detecting that the above examples are nouns, not stop words, but is this the right approach for solving my problem?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>","<p>Only you can decide whether this is the right approach. If you can integrate POS tagger in and it gives you useful results - that's good.</p>
<p>But just to give you an alternative, you could look at duplicating your fields and processing them differently. For example, if you see <strong>123-OR-A</strong> being split and stopword-cleaned, that probably means you have <a href=""http://www.solr-start.com/info/analyzers/#WordDelimiterFilterFactory"" rel=""nofollow"">WordDelimiterFilterFactory</a> in your analyzer stack. That factory has a lot of parameters you could try tweaking. Or, you could <strong>copyField</strong> your content to another (<strong>store=false</strong>) field and process it without WordDelimiterFilterFactory all together.

<p>In the app, I am displaying markers for the addresses provided by the user. My use case is such that users need to view the google map with markers when they are offline. These are primarily field users who do not have access to internet when on the field.</p>
<p>The approach I was thinking was to have users launch the google maps with markers set, in the ionic app (when they are connected to the internet) and provide a save button. Once they click on the save button, we somehow save an image/screenshot of the maps view on the device.</p>
<p>When the user opens the map while offline we load this image instead.</p>
<p>What would be the best way to save the image of the map shown in a Ionic app? Is there another approach which I should be looking at?</p>

<p>An Example of a mySQL Table is </p>
<pre></pre>
<p>And a trigger to update the created date</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Now I need to create tables similar to this in SQL Server.  There seems to be a lot of different data types available so I am unsure which to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>What data type should I use to the primary key column
(uniqueidentifier, bigint, int)? </li>
<li>What should I use for the timestamps
(timestamp, datatime, datetime2(7))? </li>
<li>How should I enforce the created
and modified timestamps (currently I am using triggers)?</li>
<li>How can I enforce foreign key constraints.</li>
<li>Should I be using Varchar(255) in SQL Server? (Maybe Text, Varchar(MAX) is better)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am using Visual Studio 2010 to create the tables.</p>","<p>First of all, you can probably use PHPMyAdmin (or something similar) to script out the table creation process to SQL Server. You can take a look at what is automatically created for you to get an idea of what you should be using. After that, you should take a look at SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) over Visual Studio 2010. Tweaking the tables that your script will create will be easier in SSMS - in fact, most database development tasks will be easier in SSMS.</p>
<p><strong>What data type should I use to the primary key column (uniqueidentifier, bigint, int)?</strong>
Depending on how many records you plan to have in your table, use int, or bigint. There are problems with uniqueidentfiers that you will probably want to avoid. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1151625/int-vs-unique-identifier-for-id-field-in-database"">INT vs Unique-Identifier for ID field in database</a></p>
<p><strong>What should I use for the timestamps (timestamp, datatime, datetime2(7))?</strong>
timestamps are different in SQL Server than in MySQL. Despite the name, a timestamp is an incrementing number that is used as a mechanism to version rows. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776%28v=sql.90%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776%28v=sql.90%29.aspx</a> . In short though, datetime is probably your best bet for compatibility purposes.</p>
<p><strong>How should I enforce the created and modified timestamps (currently I am using triggers)?</strong>
See above. Also, the SQL Server version of a ""Timestamp"" is automatically updated by the DBMS. If you need a timestamp similar to your MySQL version, you can use a trigger to do that (but that is generally frowned upon...kind of dogmatic really).</p>
<p><strong>How can I enforce foreign key constraints.</strong>
You should treat them as you would using innoDB. See this article for examples of creating foreign key constraints <a href=""http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/09/08/sql-server-%E2%80%93-2008-creating-primary-key-foreign-key-and-default-constraint/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2008/09/08/sql-server-%E2%80%93-2008-creating-primary-key-foreign-key-and-default-constraint/</a></p>
<p><strong>Should I be using Varchar(255) in SQL Server? (Maybe Text, Varchar(MAX) is better)</strong>
That depends on the data you plan to store in the field. Varchar max is equivalent to varchar(8000) and if you don't need varchar(255), you can always set it to a lower value like varchar(50). Using a field size that is too large has performance implications. One thing to note is that if you plan to support unicode (multilingual) data in your field, use nvarchar or nchar.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0

1941,How to have a popup window keep the same logic as the page it came from?,"<p>I am creating a popup chat window that allows the users to pop the call script out of the page into its own window, so that they can keep that window up but also travel to other pages of the website.  I am just grabbing the html from the call script and inserting it into the popup window.  The problem is when the options are clicked, changed, whatever by the user nothing is happening bc the new window does not have the same files as its home page.  I am wondering how can I wire up or transfer logic/functionality to the new window?  For example I need to make an ajax call, which goes into a controller in a c# file within the project.  Anyone know what I'm talking about and how to do this?</p>","<p>One approach would be to make the popup window a ""real"" page, so that the popup renders the same page, just without a layout, and all of the 'logic' (I assume this means including javascript files?) will be included.  No copying of HTML here, you're rendering the page on the server.  I'm not familiar with C#-based frameworks/web apps, but simply passing a URL query param, like 'layout=false' is an easy way to tell your script to render a page in a ""plain"" layout.  There are likely more elegant approaches available here.  For example, in a Sinatra app (Ruby), my route could detect what type of layout to use based upon some suffix on the route.   E.g. /app/chat  vs. /app/chat.part  ... oftentimes you do this to render JSON, vs HTML, and so forth.     '.part' can be anything you want, depends on if your framework allows for this (you can always roll-your-own function to examine the request vars, not that hard).</p>
<p>Another approach, which I've never tried, would be to embed or inject javascript in the html that gets copied into the popup window before allowing the popup to open.  Here is a SO answer related to that:  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760213/capture-new-browser-window-open-event-with-javascript"">Capture new browser window open event with javascript</a> </p>
<p>I think there are more advanced approaches that would include some simple Javascript in the page which downloads necessary files from the server when the popup is opened, but that seems like overkill for what you described.  My 2 cents is just use window.open, and use the query vars to tell the server what to render.  But if you're a javascript guru, by all means, get fancy.  </p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0

  the source code, you could change the color argument to the Line2D call in
  the init3d() method in matplotlib/lib/mpl_toolkits/axis3d.py</p>

1993,Flash Pro project file corrupted after a crash,"<p>I was editing a project with Flash CS6, before the crash everything was fully edited and saved correctly. However there was a crash when I was away for lunch break.</p>
<p>After a crash, I tried to open the project file again, everything loads, but settings are corrupted. Especially for Publish Profile: Target. Originally this was set to 11.4, and now is blank. Even I try to select 11.4 it will reset back to blank. All my TLF texts become invisible. When I try to create new TLF text, it says publish profile must set to target 10 or above, but there is no way I can set it (keep resetting back to blank). Another thing that happen is there r a lot of compilation error. Before the crash, no compilation error at all.</p>

<p>Is there anyway you can recover this project file?? Thank you for all the help.</p>","<p>Umm, I fixed this issue by repair the Fla file with WinRAR and removed file ""PublishSettings.xml"" inside the fla.</p>
<p>PublishSettings.xml does not even seems to be contain anything useful, but I guess this was the problem.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0
1994,Calling a WebAPI asynchronously from a Xamarin.Android event handler deadlocks,"<p>I've been struggling with this issue for a while and it's now time for me to ask my question here. So, here's the situation:</p>
<p>I've got a WebAPI, a Xamarin.Android application and an IdentityServer4 implementation. The Xamarin.Android app needs to call the WebAPI to get a list of users based on a search. This is done via an async call in a TextChanged event handler. What happens is that when the call to the WebAPI is awaited, it never returns and at some point the task gets cancelled. I've tried using ConfigureAwait(false), I've made the event handler method async void, I've read through several other questions on here about similar issues - none of the options work for me. But here's some code for you to get an idea of what I've doing:</p>
<p>The TextChanged handler:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>Here's the UsersApiClient implementation:</p>
<pre></pre>
<p>The deadlock happens on the GetStringAsync() call. I've tested the call that it makes via Postman and it is giving me the correct response. Only things I haven't tried yet are implementing the ITextWatcher interface instead of adding an event handler, and changing the code so I don't use a separate method but rather an anonymous delegate - I read in some places that that could prove to be an issue. </p>
<p>I'm really hoping some of you can help me in resolving this issue and making me understand how to do such asynchronous calls correctly. </p>
<p>Best regards.</p>","<p>Okay, so I'm not really sure what fixed the issue, but here's what I did - there was another StackOverflow question with a similar problem where the problem was solved with uninstalling the app from the emulator manually before redeploying it. I also removed the ConfigureAwait(false) call. And suddenly, everything's working. Not sure how it happened, but here it is - uninstalling the app manually and calling the API without the ConfigureAwait(false) did it.</p>",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0

1997,Rotate markers in plotly,"<p>I am trying to plot a trajectory of a fly. It consists of x,y, theta(heading)  and a timestamp. I am plotting a scatter of all the points and the triangle marker's orientation conveys the heading. What I need here is to rotate the marker based on the theta value. But I am unable to find any way of doing that in plotly.</p>
<p>I can't just use the  in the scatter markers, I need the entire range of 0-360 in float. I can do this in <a href=""http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/models/markers/triangle.html#bokeh.models.markers.Triangle.angle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bokeh</a>, but I have other issues regarding interactivity which plotly manages better. </p>

The points for each trace can be accessed  and you can then set the path attribute as shown below. Each marker is overwritten with a triangle which is rotated based on the vector to the next point.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could add the same paths as  in layout but then you can't toggle the traces. </p>
<p>Toggling works for this snippet but when the first trace is hidden the orientation is taken from the wrong trace.</p>
